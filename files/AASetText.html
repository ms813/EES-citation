<div>Editorial Office Article Alerts<br/><br/>
In addition to the comments in the referees' reports, the Editorial Office alerts you to these recently-published articles from our journal. We do this as an alerting service, to help authors keep aware in a very fast-moving field.<br/><br/>
I hope these articles are of interest, and hence may be relevant for brief discussion in any revised manuscript and  or related future work.<br/><br/>
Naturally, any reference should only be cited where you feel they are relevant and appropriate. The acceptance of your papers is of course not influenced by whether you decide to discuss these articles.<br/><br/><br/>
