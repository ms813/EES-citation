It is urgent and important to develop and optimize various energy storage and conversion technologies and materials aimed at utilization of different clean energy sources. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a new class of porous crystalline materials, act as an outstanding candidate in this field based on their high surface areas, controllable structures and excellent electrochemical properties. Here, selected recent and significant advances in the development of MOFs for clean energy applications are reviewed, and special emphases are shown to the applications of MOFs as platforms for hydrogen production and storage, fuel cells, Li-ion rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors and solar cells.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In recent years, the electron-accepting diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moiety has been receiving considerable attention for constructing donor-acceptor (D-A) type organic semiconductors for a variety of applications, particularly for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Through association of the DPP unit with appropriate electron donating building blocks, the resulting D-A molecules interact strongly in the solid state through intermolecular D-A and pi-pi interactions, leading to highly ordered structures at the molecular and microscopic levels. The closely packed molecules and crystalline domains are beneficial for intermolecular and interdomain (or intergranular) charge transport. Furthermore, the energy levels can be readily adjusted, affording p-type, n-type, or ambipolar organic semiconductors with highly efficient charge transport properties in OTFTs. In the past few years, a number of DPP-based small molecular and polymeric semiconductors have been reported to show mobility close to or greater than 1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). DPP-based polymer semiconductors have achieved record high mobility values for p-type (hole mobility: 10.5 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), n-type (electron mobility: 3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), and ambipolar (hole/electron mobilities: 1.18/1.86 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) OTFTs among the known polymer semiconductors. Many DPP-based organic semiconductors have favourable energy levels and band gaps along with high hole mobility, which enable them as promising donor materials for OPVs. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 6.05% were achieved for OPVs using DPP-based polymers, demonstrating their potential usefulness for the organic solar cell technology. This article provides an overview of the recent exciting progress made in DPP-containing polymers and small molecules that have shown high charge carrier mobility, around 0.1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) or greater. It focuses on the structural design, optoelectronic properties, molecular organization, morphology, as well as performances in OTFTs and OPVs of these high mobility DPP-based materials.</td>

This perspective will show that CO2 is the key molecule to proceed effectively in this direction. The routes, opportunities and barriers in increasing the share of renewable energy by using CO2 reaction and their impact on the chemical and energy value chains are discussed after introducing the general aspects of this topic evidencing the tight integration between the CO2 use and renewable energy insertion in the value chain of the process industry. The focus of this perspective article is on the catalytic aspects of the chemistries involved, with an analysis of the state-of-the-art, perspectives and targets to be developed. The reactions discussed are the production of short-chain olefins (ethylene, propylene) from CO2, and the conversion of carbon dioxide to syngas, formic acid, methanol and dimethyl ether, hydrocarbons via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methane. The relevance of availability, cost and environmental footprints of H-2 production routes using renewable energies is addressed. The final part discusses the possible scenario for CO2 as an intermediary for the incorporation of renewable energy in the process industry, with a concise roadmap for catalysis needs and barriers to reach this goal.</td>

We show that deactivation can be minimised by tuning hydrogen partial pressure, that original activity can be recovered by calcination, and that catalytic activity can be maintained in the presence of water.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Electrochemical cells (ECs) are devices that convert chemical energy into electricity through spontaneous oxidation-reduction reactions that occur separately at two electrodes through the transport of protons in the electrolyte solution and the flow of electrons in the external circuit. A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an effective device that converts mechanical energy into electricity using organic/polymer materials by a contact induced electrification process followed by charge separation. In this paper, we demonstrate the first integration of an EC and a TENG for simultaneously harvesting chemical and mechanical energy, and its application for powering a sensor and even personal electronics. An EC was fabricated using a Cu/NaCl solution/Al structure, on which a thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film with a micropyramid surface structure was used as the protection layer of the EC for anti-corrosion, anti-contamination and anti-mechanical damage. A TENG was fabricated based on a contact-and-separation process between the PDMS protection layer and the Al electrode layer of the EC. The output performance of the TENG can be increased by embedding BaTiO3 nanoparticles into the PDMS film layer to enhance the dielectric property. Moreover, we also demonstrated that the produced hybrid energies can be stored in a Li-ion battery for lighting up 30 green LEDs.</td>

As an important component for building an all paper-based system that can work independently and sustainably, a paper-based power source is indispensable. In this study, we demonstrated a paper-based nanogenerator (pNG) that can convert tiny-scale mechanical energy into electricity. The pNG relies on an electrostatic effect, and the electrostatic charges on the paper were generated by the corona method. The instantaneous output power density of a single-layered pNG reached similar to 90.6 mW cm(-2) at a voltage of 110 V, and this instantaneously illuminated 70 LEDs. In addition, by sticking the pNG to a movable object, such as the page of a book, the power harvested from the mechanical action of turning the page can drive an LED, which presents its outstanding potential in building paper-based, self-powered systems and as active sensors.</td>

Solar cells achieving a fill factor (FF) of &gt;60% along with high quantum efficiency in the near IR region are demonstrated for ternary composites consisting of P3HT, the fullerene-bisindene adduct of ICBA and a low bandgap copolymer sensitizer. Using P3HT as an efficient transport matrix with non-Langevin recombination dynamics allowed us to limit and overcome the otherwise dominant recombination losses of the indene-C60 bisadduct - low bandgap copolymer blends.

This catalyst, composed of a catalytic beta-Mo2C phase and an acid-proof gamma-Mo2N phase, drives the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with low overpotentials, and is highly durable in a corrosive acidic solution over a period exceeding 500 hours. When supported on graphene sheets, the MoSoy catalyst exhibits very fast charge transfer kinetics, and its performance rivals that of noble-metal catalysts such as Pt for hydrogen production. These findings prove that the soybean (as well as other high-protein biomass) is a useful material for the generation of catalysts incorporating an abundant transition metal, thereby challenging the exclusivity of platinum catalysts in the hydrogen economy.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this study, we quantified electron transfer rates, depth profiles of electron donor, and biofilm structure of Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms using an electrochemical-nuclear magnetic resonance microimaging biofilm reactor. Our goal was to determine whether electron donor limitations existed in electron transfer processes of electrode-respiring G. sulfurreducens biofilms. Cells near the top of the biofilms consumed acetate and were metabolically active; however, acetate concentration decreased to below detection within the top 100 microns of the biofilms. Additionally, porosity in the biofilms fell below 10% near the electrode surface, exacerbating exclusion of acetate from the lower regions. The dense biofilm matrix in the acetate-depleted zone acted as an electrical conduit passing electrons generated at the top of the biofilm to the electrode. To verify the distribution of cell metabolic activity, we used uranium as a redox-active probe for localizing electron transfer activity and X-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine the uranium oxidation state. Cells near the top reduced U-VI more actively than the cells near the base. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images showed intact, healthy cells near the top and plasmolyzed cells near the base. Contrary to models proposed in the literature, which hypothesize that cells nearest the electrode surface are the most metabolically active because of a lower electron transfer resistance, our results suggest that electrical resistance through the biofilm does not restrict long-range electron transfer. Cells far from the electrode can respire across metabolically inactive cells, taking advantage of their extracellular infrastructure produced during the initial biofilm formation.</td>

Even though the battery technologies have been widely investigated for a few decades, there is still a need to further improve the battery performance, cost and safety for practical applications. In the present work, a novel low-cost Na-ZnCl2 battery with a planar beta ''-Al2O3 solid electrolyte (BASE) was proposed, and its electrochemical reactions and battery performance were investigated. Compared to Na-NiCl2 chemistry, the ZnCl2-based chemistry was more complicated, in which multiple electrochemical reactions including liquid-phase formation occurred at temperatures above 253 degrees C. During the first stage of charge, NaCl reacted with Zn to form Na in the anode and Na2ZnCl4 in the cathode. Once all the NaCl was consumed, further charge with the reaction between Na2ZnCl4 and Zn led to the formation of a NaCl-ZnCl2 liquid phase. During the end of charge, the liquid phase reacted with Zn to produce solid ZnCl2. To identify the effect of liquid-phase formation on electrochemical performance, button cells were assembled and tested at 280 and 240 degrees C. At 280 degrees C, with the liquid phase formed during cycling, cells revealed quite stable cyclability. On the other hand, more rapid increase in polarization was observed at 240 degrees C where only solid-state electrochemical reactions occurred. SEM analysis indicated that the stable performance at 280 degrees C was due to the suppressed growth of Zn and NaCl particles, which were generated from the liquid phase during the discharge of each cycle.</td>

To date, however, there have been no reports on efficient bioethanol production from cyanobacterial glycogen by yeast fermentation. Additionally, multiple pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis steps of polysaccharides are required for conventional ethanol production from agricultural crops and microalgae. Here, we investigate direct ethanol production from Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis, a fast-growing halophilic cyanobacterium that accumulates large amounts of glycogen, using lysozyme and a recombinant amylase-expressing yeast strain to eliminate the need for biomass pretreatment and amylase hydrolysis. In the direct conversion process from A. platensis to ethanol, 6.5 g L-1 (ethanol productivity of 1.08 g per L per day) of ethanol was produced. The total ethanol yield based on glycogen consumption was 86% of theoretical yield, which to our knowledge, is the highest yield of bioethanol from an oxygenic photosynthetic microorganism. The present findings indicate that A. platensis is a remarkable carbohydrate feedstock in the form of glycogen, which is a promising material for the production of bioethanol and various other commercially valuable chemicals.</td>

The x = 0.7 composition had an anode polarization resistance of 0.17 Omega cm(2), at 800 degrees C in humidified H-2, much lower than the value 0.39 Omega cm(2) measured for x = 0.4 and 3.14 Omega cm(2) for x = 0. The reduced polarization resistance correlated with increased oxygen non-stoichiometry delta, which suggests that it may be related to increased ionic conductivity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements at 800 degrees C on the x = 0.7 anode cell showed a main response centered at similar to 1 Hz that increased with decreasing hydrogen partial pressure. The maximum power density observed was for the x = 0.7 cell - 337 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C in air and humidified hydrogen - and was limited mainly by the thick electrolyte.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Nature has evolved multiple enzymatic strategies for the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides, which are central to carbon flux in the biosphere and an integral part of renewable biofuels production. Many biomass-degrading organisms secrete synergistic cocktails of individual enzymes with one or several catalytic domains per enzyme, whereas a few bacteria synthesize large multi-enzyme complexes, termed cellulosomes, which contain multiple catalytic units per complex. Both enzyme systems employ similar catalytic chemistries; however, the physical mechanisms by which these enzyme systems degrade polysaccharides are still unclear. Here we examine a prominent example of each type, namely a free-enzyme cocktail expressed by the fungus Hypocrea jecorina and a cellulosome preparation secreted from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum. We observe striking differences in cellulose saccharification exhibited by these systems at the same protein loading. Free enzymes are more active on pretreated biomass and in contrast cellulosomes are much more active on purified cellulose. When combined, these systems display dramatic synergistic enzyme activity on cellulose. To gain further insights, we imaged free enzyme- and cellulosome-digested cellulose and biomass by transmission electron microscopy, which revealed evidence for different mechanisms of cellulose deconstruction by free enzymes and cellulosomes. Specifically, the free enzymes employ an ablative, fibril-sharpening mechanism, whereas cellulosomes physically separate individual cellulose microfibrils from larger particles resulting in enhanced access to cellulose surfaces. Interestingly, when the two enzyme systems are combined, we observe changes to the substrate that suggests mechanisms of synergistic deconstruction. Insight into the different mechanisms underlying these two polysaccharide deconstruction paradigms will eventually enable new strategies for enzyme engineering to overcome biomass recalcitrance.</td>

At temperatures as low as 80 degrees C polycrystalline thin films are synthesized, which index to the stoichiometric (Cu2S) chalcocite phase. As-prepared and prior to exposure to room ambient, conductive films are obtained as a result of a high mobility (4 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and a relatively moderate p-type doping of 10(18) cm(-3). However, exposure to air results in a rapid rise in conductivity due to heavy p-type doping (&gt;10(20) cm(-3)). The evolving electronic properties in air are correlated with a change in both crystalline phase and optical constants. Surface analysis corroborates a copper deficiency induced by room temperature oxidation in air. Surprisingly, storage in a &lt;0.1 ppm oxygen and water atmosphere significantly slows but does not halt the rise in conductivity with time. However, an Al2O3 overlayer-also grown by ALD-results in significantly lower carrier concentrations as well as dramatically slower carrier addition with time, even under ambient conditions. The implications for future use of Cu2S in more efficient (p/n(+)) and stable thin film photovoltaics are discussed.</td>

The resulting thylakoid-carbon nanotube composites showed high photo-electrochemical activity under illumination. Multiple membrane proteins have been observed to participate in direct electron transfer with the electrode, resulting in the generation of photocurrents, the first of its kind reported for natural photosynthetic systems. Upon inclusion of a mediator, the photo-activity was enhanced. The major contributor to the photocurrent was the light-induced water oxidation reaction at the photosystem II complex. The thylakoid-MWNT composite electrode yielded a maximum current density of 68 mA cm(-2) and a steady state current density of 38 mA cm(-2), which are two orders of magnitude larger than previously reported for similar systems. The high electrochemical activity of the thylakoid-MWNT composites has significant implications for both photosynthetic energy conversion and photofuel production applications. A fuel cell type photosynthetic electrochemical cell developed using a thylakoid-MWNT composite anode and laccase cathode produced a maximum power density of 5.3 mW cm(-2), comparable to that of enzymatic fuel cells. The carbon based nanostructured electrode has the potential to serve as an excellent immobilization support for photosynthetic electrochemistry based on the molecular tethering approach as demonstrated in this work.</td>

In an attempt to alter biofilm properties, genes encoding proteins with a PilZ domain were deleted from the G. sulfurreducens genome. A strain, in which the gene GSU1240 was deleted, designated strain CL-1, formed biofilms much more effectively than did the wildtype strain. Increased production of pili and exopolysaccharide were associated with the enhanced biofilm production. When grown with an electrode as the electron acceptor CL-1 produced biofilms that were 6-fold more conductive than wild-type biofilms. The greater conductivity lowered the potential losses in microbial fuel cells, decreasing the charge transfer resistance at the biofilm-anode surface by ca. 60% and lowering the formal potential by 50 mV. These lower potential losses increased the potential energy of electrons reaching the biofilm-anode interface and enabled strain CL-1 to produce 70% higher power densities than the wild-type strain. Current-producing biofilms were highly cohesive and could be peeled off graphite electrodes intact, yielding a novel conductive biological material. This study demonstrates that simple genetic manipulation can yield improved bioelectronics materials with energy applications.</td>

The donor-bridge-acceptor ligand consists of a perylene chromophore linked via a xylene bridge to a pyridyl-substituted 1,8-naphthalimide electron acceptor. Coordination of the ligand to the catalyst [Co(dmgBF(2))(2)(L)(2)], where dmgBF(2) - (difluoroboryl) dimethylglyoximato and L water or a solvent molecule, yields a donor-bridge-acceptor-catalyst triad assembly. Photoexcitation with 416 nm laser pulses generates the perylene S-1 excited state. Subsequent electron transfer from perylene to the acceptor occurs in tau = 9.0 +/- 0.1 ps followed by electron transfer to the catalyst in tau = 6 +/- 1 ps. Of the charge-separated state population formed, 79 +/- 1% undergoes charge recombination to either the singlet ground state (tau = 0.8 +/- 0.1 ns) or the perylene triplet state (tau = 4.3 +/- 0.1 ns). Co(I)-pyridyl bond dissociation with tau = 2.4 +/- 0.2 ns competes with intramolecular charge recombination resulting in a 21 +/- 1% yield of dissociated oxidized photosensitizer and reduced catalyst. Subsequent diffusional charge recombination occurs with k = (1.8 +/- 0.2) x 10(10) M-1 s(-1). This detailed analysis of the electron transfer and dissociation dynamics of an integrated photosensitizer-catalyst system will inform the rational design of novel molecular assemblies that efficiently absorb photons, transfer electrons, and catalyze fuel-forming reactions.</td>

Here, we present quantitative evolution of bi-hierarchical nanostructure of D-A copolymers and fullerenes by employing grazing-incidence small/wide angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS/GIWAXS) techniques and [2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b']-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)]/[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCPDTBT/PCBM) BHJ as model materials. An accurate GISAXS model analysis is established herein for revealing the distinctive bi-hierarchical nanostructures from molecular level to a scale of hundreds of nanometers. The mechanisms of hierarchical formation and mutual influence between PCPDTBT and PCBM domains are proposed to correlate with photovoltaic properties. These results provide a comprehensive interpretation in respect to previous studies on the nanostructures of D-A copolymer/fullerene BHJs. It is helpful for optimum structural design and associated synthesis improvement for achieving high efficiency BHJ solar cells.</td>

The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and improved electrical conductivity by the Ag NPs clearly contributed to increments in light absorption/emission in the active layer as well as the conductivity of the PEDOT: PSS electrode in PSCs and PLEDs. The ITO-free bulk heterojunction PSCs showed a 1% absolute enhancement in the power conversion efficiency (3.27 to 4.31%), and the power efficiency of the PLEDs was improved by 124% (3.75 to 8.4 lm W-1) compared to the reference devices without Ag NPs. The solution-processable conducting polymer, PEDOT: PSS with Ag NPs, can be a promising electrode for large area and flexible optoelectronic devices with a low-cost fabrication process.</td>

A significant improvement of the conductivity of PEDOT: PSS films (from similar to 1 S cm(-1) to more than 1000 S cm(-1)) was achieved by GMS modification and the highest conductivity reaches 1019 S cm(-1) for Clevios PH 1000 under an optimized spin-coating speed of GMS layer. The Clevios PH 1000/GMS bilayer film exhibits a sheet resistance of 98 U sq(-1) and a transparency of around 80% in the visible range, which are comparable to those of ITO, fulfilling its function as the transparent anode. The conductivity improvement by GMS modification is proposed to result from the GMS-induced segregation of PSS chains and the conformational change of the conductive PEDOT chains within PEDOT: PSS. While the highly hydrophobic -(CH2)(16)CH3 groups of GMS preferentially interact with the hydrophobic PEDOT of PEDOT: PSS, the highly hydrophilic -COOCH2-CHOH-CH2OH groups preferentially interact with the hydrophilic PSS chains with the hydroxyl groups playing an important role on the consequent phase separation between PEDOT and PSS chains. Using Clevios PH 1000/GMS bilayer films as the transparent anodes replacing ITO, high-efficiency ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices based on poly[N-9 ''-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) blended with [6,6]-phenyl C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (PCDTBT:PC71BM) and thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):PC71BM systems exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 5.90% and 7.06%, respectively, which are comparable to the corresponding devices based on the traditional ITO anode.</td>

The carbon layer is a few nm thick covering the surface of hematite nanostructures. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the electronic structure of hematite was significantly modified with the existence of oxygen vacancy, which was responsible for the remarkable photocurrent. The carbon layer plays an important role for the appearance of oxygen vacancy. The simple and cheap method could be scaled up easily which may pave the way for the practical application for efficient solar water splitting.</td>

Such platform molecules are well-chosen to lie at the base of a large product assortment, while their formation should be straightforward from the refined biomass, practical and energy efficient, without unnecessary loss of carbon atoms. Lactic acid has been identified as one such high potential platform. Despite its established fermentation route, sustainability issues - like gypsum waste and cost factors due to multi-step purification and separation requirements - will arise as soon as the necessary orders of magnitude larger volumes are needed. Innovative production routes to lactic acid and its esters are therefore under development, converting sugars and glycerol in the presence of chemocatalysts. Moreover, catalysis is one of the fundamental routes to convert lactic acid into a range of useful chemicals in a platform approach. This contribution attempts a critical overview of all advances in the field of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and recognises a great potential of some of these chemocatalytic approaches to produce and transform lactic acid as well as some other promising alpha-hydroxy acids.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this report, the bio-inspired photocatalytic regeneration of NADH employing graphitic carbon nitride photocatalysis with a diatom frustule structure was presented. The functional structure was constructed from green and sustainable diatomite (diatom earth) by an "incipient wetness impregnation" method. By using [Cp*Rh(bpy) H2O](2+) as an electron mediator, the NADH yield can reach nearly 100%, with the enzymatically active 1,4-NADH being the only product. Furthermore, even without an electron mediator, a direct electron transfer between graphitic carbon nitride and beta-NAD(+) was possible and NADH could still be regenerated. Diatom-based carbon nitride showed a substantial improvement in regeneration efficiency compared with mpg-C3N4 which has a higher specific surface area. This was ascribed to the diatom structure, with its enhanced light trapping and scattering promoting high photocatalytic efficiency. Furthermore, abundant species of diatoms in the earth offer more possibilities to construct an artificial photosynthetic system using diatom frustules with excellent light-to-energy conversion efficiency.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Steady-state irradiation under visible light of a covalent Ir(III)-photosensitized polyoxotungstate is reported. In the presence of a sacrificial electron donor, photolysis leads to a very efficient photoreduction of the polyoxometalate. Successive formation of the one-electron and two-electron reduced species, which are unambiguously identified by comparison with spectroelectrochemical measurements, is observed with a significantly faster rate reaction for the formation of the one-electron reduced species. The kinetics of the photoreduction, which are correlated with the reduction potentials of the polyoxometalate (POM), can be finely tuned by the presence of an acid. Indeed light-driven formation of the two-electron reduced POM is considerably facilitated in the presence of acetic acid. The system is also able to perform photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light without significant loss of performance over more than 1 week of continuous photolysis and displays higher photocatalytic efficiency than the related multi-component system, outlining the decisive effect of the covalent bonding between the POM and the photosensitizer. This functional and modular system constitutes a promising step for the development of charge photoaccumulation devices and subsequent photoelectrocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.</td>

A fundamental understanding of the exchange current density of the HER/HOR in alkaline media is critical for the search and design of highly active electrocatalysts. By studying the HER on a series of monometallic surfaces, we demonstrate that the HER exchange current density in alkaline solutions can be correlated with the calculated hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on the metal surfaces via a volcano type of relationship. The HER activity varies by several orders of magnitude from Pt at the peak of the plot to W and Au located on the bottom of each side of the plot, similar to the observation in acids. Such a correlation suggests that the HBE can be used as a descriptor for identifying electrocatalysts for HER/HOR in alkaline media, and that the HER exchange current density can be tuned by modifying the surface chemical properties.</td>

Batch-to-batch variations in the nature and quantity of such impurities leads to widespread issues with irreproducible optoelectronic function, yet to date no technique has emerged that is reliably capable of identifying the character of impurities or their concentration in organic photovoltaic active layer blends. Here we focus on state-of-the-art, high-performance bulk heterojunction blends and show that synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence can detect and quantify trace concentrations of metal impurities in these systems. Adopting a strategy of artificially introducing known quantities of additional catalyst into polymer/fullerene blends, we identify both the threshold concentration at which performance degrades and the mechanism for the degradation. With the knowledge of a target impurity concentration and a technique in hand to accurately measure their presence, researchers can implement materials preparation processes to achieve consistent, high performance in organic solar cells.</td>

Compared with stacked graphene, which has a wrinkled structure, the use of unfolded graphene enables better dispersion of LiFePO4 and restricts the LiFePO4 particle size at the nanoscale. More importantly, it allows each LiFePO4 particle to be attached to the conducting layer, which could greatly enhance the electronic conductivity, thereby realizing the full potential of the active materials. Based on its superior structure, after post-treatment for 12 hours, the LiFePO4-unfolded graphene nanocomposite achieved a discharge capacity of 166.2 mA h g(-1) in the 1st cycle, which is 98% of the theoretical capacity (170 mA h g(-1)). The composite also displayed stable cycling behavior up to 100 cycles, whereas the LiFePO4-stacked graphene composite with a similar carbon content could deliver a discharge capacity of only 77 mA h g(-1) in the 1st cycle. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) provided spectroscopic understanding of the crystallinity of LiFePO4 and chemical bonding between LiFePO4 and unfolded graphene.</td>

Both ingot samples and spark plasma sintered (SPS) samples were studied and the properties are compared. We present detailed structural, spectroscopic and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data, and transport properties of both cast ingot and SPS samples. The SPS processed samples with HgTe as the second phase show better thermoelectric properties than those with CdTe mainly because of more effective phonon scattering. The SPS process gives significantly lower lattice thermal conductivity for the p-type PbTe-HgTe system than the cast ingot. The same effect is not observed in the p-type PbTe-CdTe system. A maximum ZT of similar to 1.64 at similar to 770 K is achieved for the p-type PbTe-2% HgTe-1% Na2Te SPS sample. TEM studies reveal the formation of nanostructures whose number density generally increases with increasing concentrations of CdTe and HgTe as the second phase. Meso-scale grain boundaries along with nanostructured precipitates in the SPS samples play an important role in significantly reducing the lattice thermal conductivity compared to cast ingot in the case of p-type PbTe-HgTe.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A molten salt electrochemical system comprising a eutectic mixture of Li-Na-K carbonates, a Ni cathode, and a SnO2 inert anode is proposed for the capture and electrochemical conversion of CO2. It is demonstrated that CO2 can be effectively captured by molten carbonates, and subsequently electrochemically split into amorphous carbon on the cathode, and oxygen gas at the anode. The carbon materials generated at the cathode exhibit high BET surface areas of more than 400 m(2) g(-1) and as such, represent value-added products for a variety of applications such as energy storage and pollutant adsorption. In the carbonate eutectic (500 degrees C), the presence of Li2CO3 is shown to be required for the deposition of carbon from the melt, wherein O-2(-) or Li2O serves as the intermediate for CO2 capture and electrochemical conversion. SnO2 proved to be an effective anode for the electrochemical evolution of oxygen. Electrochemical reactions were found to proceed at relatively high current efficiencies, even though the current densities exceed 50 mA cm(-2). The intrinsic nature of alkaline oxides for CO2 capture, the conversion of CO2 to value-added products, and the ability to drive the process with renewable energy sources such as solar power, enables the technology to be engineered for high flux capture and utilization of CO2.</td>

The structure of the cascaded heterojunction, which encourages spatial separation of the geminate charge pair, is varied to recreate that found in ternary blends and tri-layers, as well as that formed by self-organization in binary blends in which one component crystallizes. It is shown that substantial reductions in charge recombination can indeed be achieved with parameters similar that reported for P3HT:PCBM solar cells. However, the efficacy of cascaded energy heterojunctions is shown to be limited for thick cascade layers (&gt;10 nm). This provides guidance as how to design ternary organic photovoltaics, whilst also offering a possible explanation of low recombination efficiency in some semi-crystalline OPVs.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Large-scale energy storage represents a key challenge for renewable energy and new systems with low cost, high energy density and long cycle life are desired. In this article, we develop a new lithium/polysulfide (Li/PS) semi-liquid battery for large-scale energy storage, with lithium polysulfide (Li2S8) in ether solvent as a catholyte and metallic lithium as an anode. Unlike previous work on Li/S batteries with discharge products such as solid state Li2S2 and Li2S, the catholyte is designed to cycle only in the range between sulfur and Li2S4. Consequently all detrimental effects due to the formation and volume expansion of solid Li2S2/Li2S are avoided. This novel strategy results in excellent cycle life and compatibility with flow battery design. The proof-of-concept Li/PS battery could reach a high energy density of 170 W h kg(-1) and 190 W h L-1 for large scale storage at the solubility limit, while keeping the advantages of hybrid flow batteries. We demonstrated that, with a 5 M Li2S8 catholyte, energy densities of 97 W h kg(-1) and 108 W h L-1 can be achieved. As the lithium surface is well passivated by LiNO3 additive in ether solvent, internal shuttle effect is largely eliminated and thus excellent performance over 2000 cycles is achieved with a constant capacity of 200 mA h g(-1). This new system can operate without the expensive ion-selective membrane, and it is attractive for large-scale energy storage.</td>

The ion conductivity decreased as the membrane thickness increased; however, the long term-stability of the devices improved with increasing membrane thickness. Nanoparticles encapsulated in a thick membrane (ca. 37 nm), obtained using a 90 min polymerization time, exhibited excellent pore filling among TiO2 particles. This nanoparticle layer was used to fabricate a thin-layered, quasi-solid state DSC. The thick membrane prevented short-circuit paths from forming between the counter and the TiO2 electrode, thereby reducing the minimum necessary electrode separation distance. The quasi-solid state DSC yielded a high power conversion efficiency (7.6 -&gt; 8.1%) and excellent stability during heating at 65 degrees C over 30 days. These performance characteristics were superior to those obtained from a conventional DSC (7.5 -&gt; 3.5%) prepared using a TiO2 active layer with the same thickness. The reduced electrode separation distance shortened the charge transport pathways, which compensated for the reduced ion conductivity in the polymer gel electrolyte. Excellent pore filling on the TiO2 particles minimized the exposure of the dye to the liquid and reduced dye detachment.</td>

We describe energy efficiency loss mechanisms, particularly in context to the deposition of PbO2 at the positive electrode. The morphology and crystal structure of deposits formed at the positive electrode, under galvanostatic and potentiostatic conditions, were characterized using both powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Rietveld refinements were performed to quantitatively determine the phase fraction of alpha- and beta-PbO2 formed. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to describe the charge-transfer reaction occurring at the positive electrode during conditions that promote the formation of various PbO2 morphologies. These features were used to evaluate and predict the long-term cycling stability of SLFBs as well as to diagnose potential problems arising during battery operation. We demonstrate that conditions optimized to preferentially deposit nanoscale PbO2 leads to long battery lifetimes, exceeding 2000 cycles at 79% energetic efficiency.</td>

Firstly, one densely stacked, smooth CdTe film with a wide absorption range and sufficient water resistance is obtained and used for fabricating the PHJ device. A PCE of 3.75% is obtained, which is comparable to the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices. Secondly, the n-i structure is constructed by replacing the PPV layer with a mixed solution consisting of the PPV precursor and CdTe NCs. The n-i structure shows improved photocurrent with lowered fill factor (FF). The low FF is attributed to the severe phase separation of the PPV: CdTe layer, which is caused by the hydrophobicity of the annealed CdTe layer. Subsequently, the hydrophilicity of the annealed CdTe layer is improved by spin-coating an aqueous solution of CdCl2, which greatly increases the FF. Eventually, a record power conversion efficiency of 4.76% is achieved and the maximum J(sc) can reach 16.08 mA cm(-2).</td>

However, this pattern of conjugated linker alternation is associated with an 80 mV negative shift of the ground-state oxidation potential, which dominates an almost 5 times reduced rate of hole injection from the oxidized state of C253 to the divalent tris(2,2'-bipyridine) cobalt (Co-bpy) cation in the redox electrolyte, resulting in a considerably poor net charge separation yield. On the other side, a dye-sensitized solar cell employing the C252 photosensitizer and the Co-bpy electrolyte exhibits a good power conversion efficiency of 9.5% measured under the 100 mW cm(-2) simulated AM1.5 sunlight. The dissimilarity of cell photovoltage is scrutinized by evaluating the shift of the titania conduction band edge and the variation of interfacial charge recombination kinetics, the latter of which presents a clear correlation with dye coating thickness on titania derived from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Our work has underlined the important energetic and kinetic interplays which should be seriously considered in the further optimization of active components in dye-sensitized solar cells.</td>

More importantly, an optimized porous rutile TiO2 NRAs with a large internal surface area was fabricated on the FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) substrate via a secondary hydrothermal treatment and when applied as the photoanodes in DSCs, a record efficiency of 7.91% was achieved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In pursuing higher energy density with no sacrifice of power density, a supercapacitor-battery hybrid energy storage device-combining an electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) type positive electrode with a Li-ion battery type negative electrode-has been designed and fabricated. Graphene is introduced to both electrodes: an Fe3O4/graphene (Fe3O4/G) nanocomposite with high specific capacity as negative electrode material, and a graphene-based three-dimensional porous carbon material (3DGraphene) with high surface area (similar to 3355 m(2) g(-1)) as positive electrode material. The Fe3O4/G nanocomposite shows a high reversible specific capacity exceeding 1000 mA h g(-1) at 90 mA g(-1) and remaining at 704 mA h g(-1) at 2700 mA g(-1), as well as excellent rate capability and improved cycle stability. Meanwhile the 3DGraphene positive electrode also displays great electrochemical performance. With these two graphene-enhanced electrode materials and using the best recommended industry evaluation method, the hybrid supercapacitor Fe3O4/G//3DGraphene demonstrates an ultrahigh energy density of 147 W h kg(-1) (power density of 150 W kg(-1)), which also remains of 86 W h kg(-1) even at high power density of 2587 W kg(-1), so far the highest value of the reported hybrid supercapacitors. Furthermore, the energy density of the hybrid supercapacitor is comparable to lithium ion batteries, and the power density also reaches that of symmetric supercapacitors, indicating that the hybrid supercapacitor could be a very promising novel energy storage system for fast and efficient energy storage in the future.</td>

Here we report a photoelectrochemical/photosynthetic cell based on inorganic semiconductor photoelectrodes that shows the long-term operational stability necessary for the production of solar fuels and chemicals. The cell's stability is achieved by forming an active device using an inexpensive spin casted (20 nm) transparent conducting polymer coating (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)). PEDOT: PSS protects the photoelectrodes from photoelectrochemical corrosion and functionally serve as either a Schottky contact or as an efficient hole transport layer depending upon the choice and design of the underlying semiconductor heterostructure. Coated semiconductors were assessed both as photoelectrochemical and as freestanding, "autonomous" photosynthetic units and found to be stable for over 12 hours (for wired configuration) in corrosive electrolytes. The solar-to-chemical conversion efficiencies match or exceed devices with more expensive metal-based coatings. Furthermore, the PEDOT: PSS was found to have high electrocatalytic activity, thus no additional electrocatalyst was required. The results suggest a pathway to large scale, inexpensive, hybrid organic-inorganic solar-to-chemical energy conversion systems.</td>

In this article, the current status of the decarbonization of the global economy and constraints and challenges of near-to-mid term carbon mitigation options are analyzed using the Kaya Identity modeling tool. Dramatic reductions in both energy and carbon intensities of the world economy would be necessary to stop and reverse the worrisome re-carbonizing trends, however, for the majority of promising low-carbon technologies, the competition with fossil incumbents is currently an uphill battle. The pivotal role of the three-way energy system comprising methane, non-carbon electricity and hydrogen (hence, dubbed Decarbonization Triangle) in catalyzing the decarbonization process is examined in this paper. The analysis of current tendencies shows that despite recent drastic increases in carbon emissions, there are signs of emerging positive decarbonizing trends fueled by a recent surge in supply of natural gas, booming renewables market and significant gains in energy efficiency. If further strengthened, these trends may put decarbonization back on its positive historical path.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Two prominent low-carbon energy resources, wind and sunlight, depend on weather. As the percentage of electricity supply from these sources increases, grid operators will need to employ strategies and technologies, including energy storage, to balance supply with demand. We quantify energy and material resource requirements for currently available energy storage technologies: lithium ion (Li-ion), sodium sulfur (NaS) and lead-acid (PbA) batteries; vanadium redox (VRB) and zinc-bromine (ZnBr) flow batteries; and geologic pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS) and compressed air energy storage (CAES). By introducing new concepts, including energy stored on invested (ESOI), we map research avenues that could expedite the development and deployment of grid-scale energy storage. ESOI incorporates several storage attributes instead of isolated properties, like efficiency or energy density. Calculations indicate that electrochemical storage technologies will impinge on global energy supplies for scale up - PHS and CAES are less energy intensive by 100 fold. Using ESOI we show that an increase in electrochemical storage cycle life by tenfold would greatly relax energetic constraints for grid-storage and improve cost competitiveness. We find that annual material resource production places tight limits on Li-ion, VRB and PHS development and loose limits on NaS and CAES. This analysis indicates that energy storage could provide some grid flexibility but its build up will require decades. Reducing financial cost is not sufficient for creating a scalable energy storage infrastructure. Most importantly, for grid integrated storage, cycle life must be improved to improve the scalability of battery technologies. As a result of the constraints on energy storage described here, increasing grid flexibility as the penetration of renewable power generation increases will require employing several additional techniques including demand-side management, flexible generation from base-load facilities and natural gas firming.</td>

Several disadvantages of these catalyst supports, however, limit the catalyst performance leading to reduced fuel cell performance and durability: low resistance to corrosion at high potentials, micropores leading to limited accessible surface, impermeability to gases and liquids, and no proton conductivity. Therefore, development of novel supports or modified carbon materials is essential to commercialization of low temperature fuel cell technology. Due to unique metallic/semiconductor characteristics along with excellent environmental stability, facile synthesis and high conductivity, polypyrrole (PPy), a member of the conjugated heterocyclic conducting polymers, has been considered the most promising alternative to carbon supports in fuel cells. Extensive research on PPy-containing catalysts has been reported in the last twenty years. This paper systematically and critically reviews the progress and main achievements of PPy use in both anode and cathode catalysts for low temperature fuel cells. Insight into the remaining challenges and future research directions is also discussed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>For the first time, the role of isovalent Zr substitution in cerium oxide on the non-stoichiometry induced dilation (chemical expansion) was investigated. Chemical expansion was derived experimentally using HTXRD, dilatometry, and TGA measurements on Pr0.1Zr0.4Ce0.5O1.95-delta and computationally with DFT calculations on Zr0.5Ce0.5O2-delta. Though Zr was found to increase the reducibility and the corresponding chemical expansion of ceria in the studied range, the relationship between chemical expansion and non-stoichiometry (the chemical expansion coefficient) was significantly smaller (54% less) than that observed in ceria, and consistent with predictions from the authors' previous work. The origin of the reduced chemical expansion coefficient, associated with a larger contraction of the lattice around oxygen vacancies, is explained using DFT calculations and corroborated with prior investigations of enhanced reducibility of ceria-zirconia. Additionally, implications of this discovery for solid oxide fuel cells and heterogeneous catalyst systems are also discussed.</td>

More importantly, the deliverable capacity (58 bar to 5.8 bar) for NU-125 is 67% of the deliverable capacity of a CNG tank that starts at 248 bar. (For crystalline granules or powders, particle packing inefficiencies will yield densities and deliverable capacities lower than 86% and 67% of high-pressure CNG.) This material was synthesized in high yield on a gram-scale in a single-batch synthesis. Methane adsorption isotherms were measured over a wide pressure range (0.1-58 bar) and repeated over twelve cycles on the same sample, which showed no detectable degradation. Adsorption of CO2 and H-2 over a broad range of pressures and temperatures are also reported and agree with our computational findings.</td>

By conjunction of the experimental data with finite element simulation, we show that the output open-circuit voltage of the nanogenerator can serve as an active sensor for a self-powered weight measurement system. By active sensor we mean that the sensor automatically gives an electric output signal without applying an external power source, which can be used to directly quantify the mechanical triggering applied onto the nanogenerator.</td>

Under the optimal photocatalytic conditions [photoirradiation at lambda &gt;= 420 nm, [Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2 as the photosensor, Na2S2O8 as the oxidant in borate buffer (pH = 9.0)], the turnover number (TON) can reach as high as 360, the initial quantum yield and the initial turnover frequency (TOF) for the first 60 seconds was 27% and 0.5 s(-1), respectively. Variables of the photocatalytic reaction, including catalyst concentrations, buffer types and concentrations, pHs, dye concentrations, oxidant concentrations, etc., were systemically studied. The oxygen atoms of the evolved oxygen came from water, as confirmed by isotope-labeled experiments. In the thermal water oxidation, the TON and oxygen yield were measured to be 15 and 60%, respectively. The stability of 1 was tested and confirmed with multiple experiments (laser flash photolysis, DLS, CV, FT-IR, EDX, and catalyst recycling) within the photocatalytic water oxidation duration, which ruled out the possibility that neither the free Co2+ ions were present in the reaction solution nor were cobalt oxide/hydroxide nanoparticles in situ formed from the assumed decomposition of 1. All the evidence stated here collectively supports that 1 is the true molecular catalyst. In addition, the recycled sample was reused for water oxidation catalysis and showed similar catalytic behaviors (kinetics and activity) to that of the freshly prepared catalyst. No insoluble forms where found when the borate buffer solution of 1 was aged for 2 months, whereas its analogue, K-8[(CoCoII)-Co-II(H2O)W11O39] (4), is rapidly decomposed to a blue-purple cobalt oxide precipitate in borate buffer. The stability difference between 1 and 4 indicates that the +3 oxidation state of the central cobalt in 1 plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity. A series of other Keggin-type POMs, such as K-6[(CoW12O40)-W-II] (2), K-5[(CoW12O40)-W-III] (3), K-6[SiCoII(H2O)W11O39] (5), and K-5[PCoII(H2O)W11O39] (6), were also evaluated for their catalytic activity by comparison with 1. Our study demonstrates that the unique structural features of the mixed-valent central and peripheral cobalt atoms are essential for 1 to maintain both catalytic stability and efficiency.</td>

In this paper, we describe unique spatial organic solar cells featuring nanobowl array structures that capture more light and generate more power than planar organic solar cells. To construct bilayer solar cells, we used electrochemical deposition (with polystyrene beads as the template) to fabricate poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanobowl arrays, functioning as the hole extraction layer, on indium tin oxide substrates and then deposited copper phthalocyanine and a fullerene (C-60 or C-70) to function as the active layer, onto the nanobowl arrays. By implementing this spatial structure, we could control the active layer's thickness, such that it would be suitable for exciton dissociation, while maintaining a high absorption of incident light (by increasing the absorber volume without decreasing the area of the donor-acceptor interface, such that the light path in the active layer was increased) and ensuring high exciton dissociation efficiency (by enlarging the donor-acceptor interface). Relative to an equally thick planar control active layer the photocurrent generated by such bilayer solar cells increased by approximately 90%.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A significant amount of energy stored in the form of salinity in seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) brine can be harvested by a pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) process for power generation. The crucial performance-determining factor of the PRO process is the semi-permeable PRO membrane, which separates the SWRO brine from a lower salinity solution and sustains the salinity difference between the two solutions. However, accumulation of solutes in the support membrane, namely internal concentration polarization (ICP), significantly reduces the effective salinity difference and thus severely limits the efficiency of conventional PRO membranes. In this paper, we report the fabrication and optimization of thin-film nanofiber composite PRO (TNC-PRO) membranes with a unique support membrane structure (interconnected, low tortuousness and highly porous properties), aiming to facilitate mixing of accumulated solutes with a dilute feed stream and overcome the ICP problem. With such low structure parameter (S) value (150 mu m) nanofiber support membranes (NSMs), the optimum water permeability (A) and solute permeability (B) of the TNC-PRO membrane for power generation were determined to be 4.1 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1) and 1.74 L m(-2) h(-1) respectively. This highly efficient TNC-PRO membrane can achieve a power density of 15.2 W m(-2) and maximum energy recovery of 0.86 kW h m(-3), using synthetic brackish water (80 mM NaCl, pi = 3.92 bar) and seawater brine (1.06 M NaCl, pi = 51.8 bar) as feed and draw solution, respectively. For a more dilute synthetic river water (0.9 mM NaCl, pi = 0.045 bar) feed solution, the same membrane can achieve a higher power density of 21.3 W m(-2). The main performance limiting factors in PRO application such as ICP, External Concentration Polarization (ECP) and Reverse Solute Permeation (RSP) are quantified and their values are related to A, B and S values of TNC-PRO membranes.</td>

The success of deposition of Cu2O nanoparticles was corroborated by structural and composition characterizations. The enhanced absorption in the visible light region was observed in Cu2O/TiO2 composite nanotubes. The largely improved separation of photogenerated electrons and holes was revealed by photocurrent measurements. Consequently, Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction photoelectrodes exhibited a more effective photoconversion capability than TiO2 nanotubes alone in photoelectrochemical measurements. Furthermore, Cu2O/TiO2 composite photoelectrodes also possessed superior photoelectrocatalytic activity and stability in the degradation of Rhodamine B. Intriguingly, by selecting an appropriate bias potential, a synergistic effect between electricity and visible light irradiation can be achieved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We report a quantum mechanical investigation on the nature of electronic trap states in realistic models of individual and sintered anatase TiO2 nanocrystals (NCs) of ca. 3 nm diameter. We find unoccupied electronic states of lowest energy to be localized within the central part of the NCs, and to originate from under-coordinated surface Ti atoms lying mainly at the edges between the (100) and (101) facets. These localized states are found at about 0.3-0.4 eV below the fully delocalized conduction band states, in good agreement with both electrochemical and spectro-electrochemical results. The overall Density-Of-States (DOS) below the conduction band (CB) can be accurately fitted to an exponential distribution of states, in agreement with capacitance data. Water molecules adsorbed on the NC surface raise the energy and reduce the number of localized states, thus modifying the DOS. As a possible origin of additional trap states, we further investigated the oriented attachment of two TiO2 NCs at various possible interfaces. For the considered models, we found only minor differences between the DOS of two interacting NCs and those of the individual constituent NCs. Our results point at the presence of inherent trap states even in perfectly stoichiometric and crystalline TiO2 NCs due to the unavoidable presence of under-coordinated surface Ti(IV) ions at the (100) facets.</td>

Although biological remediation has proved to be efficient in industrial applications, no biotechnology solution is currently operational for highly radioactive media. Such a solution requires organisms that accumulate radionuclides while withstanding radioactivity. This paper describes the potentialities of an extremophile autotrophic eukaryote, Coccomyxa actinabiotis nov. sp., that we isolated from a nuclear facility and which withstands huge ionizing radiation doses, up to 20 000 Gy. Half the population survives 10 000 Gy, which is comparable to the hyper-radioresistant well-known prokaryote Deinococcus radiodurans. The cell metabolic profile investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance was hardly affected by radiation doses of up to 10 000 Gy. Cellular functioning completely recovered within a few days. This outstanding microalga also strongly accumulates radionuclides, including U-238, Cs-137, Ag-110m, Co-60, Mn-54, Zn-65, and C-14 (decontamination above 85% in 24 h, concentration factor, 1000-450 000 mL g(-1) fresh weight). In 1 h, the microalga revealed as effective as the conventional physico-chemical ion-exchangers to purify nuclear effluents. Using this organism, an efficient real-scale radionuclide bio-decontamination process was performed in a nuclear fuel storage pool with an important reduction of waste volume compared to the usual physico-chemical process. The feasibility of new decontamination solutions for the nuclear industry and for environmental clean-up operations is demonstrated.</td>

In these experiments the spectral response of TiO2 derivatized with [Ru(bpy)(2)(4,4'-((HO)(2)PO)(2)bpy)](2+) (RuP, where bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine, (4,4'-((HO)(2)PO)(2)bpy) is [2,2'-bipyridine]-4,4'-diphosphonic acid) arises from electric field (Stark) effects on the metal-to-ligand-charge transfer (MLCT) absorption spectrum of RuP, which is screened by cation intercalation. These results verify that Li+ diffusion is coupled to electron injection and to electron recombination/extraction at the TiO2 interface. Li+ doping levels depend on the competition between dynamics of its intercalation and electron recombination/transport. For a DSPEC operating in aqueous solution at pH 4.5, the observed rate constants for Li+ intercalation and release were 0.22 s(-1) and 0.014 s(-1), respectively. Both processes were considerably slower in the more viscous solvent propylene carbonate with Li+ release rate constants &lt;2 x 10(-4) s(-1). Accumulation of Li+ under these conditions shifts conduction band/trap states to less negative potentials, increasing electron lifetime in TiO2.</td>

We suggest that the activation is provided by the natural constituents in the leaves composed of soft organics and metals. Although the detailed study performed and reported here is on dead Neem leaves (Azadirachta indica), the process is clearly generic and applicable to most forms of dead leaves. Indeed we have examined the case of dead Ashoka leaves as well. The comparison between the Neem and Ashoka leaves brings out the importance of the constitution and composition of the bio-source in the nature of carbon formed and its properties. We also discuss and compare the cases of pyrolysis of green leaves as well as un-ground dead leaves with that of ground dead leaf powder studied in full detail. The concurrent high conductivity and microporosity realized in our carbonaceous materials are key to the high energy supercapacitor application. Indeed, our synthesized functional carbon exhibits a very high specific capacitance of 400 F g(-1) and an energy density of 55 W h kg(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) in aqueous 1 M H2SO4. The areal capacitance value of the carbon derived from dead (Neem) plant leaves (CDDPL) is also significantly high (32 mu F cm(-2)). In an organic electrolyte the material shows a specific capacitance of 88 F g(-1) at a current density of 2 A g(-1).</td>

The interplay between optical and photovoltaic properties with the incident light angle is discussed. We demonstrate that an efficiency enhancement is attained for PC-DSCs at all angles measured, and that rational design of the photonic crystal back mirror leads to a reduction of the photocurrent losses related to the tilt angle of the cell, usually labeled as cosine losses. Angular variations of the cell transparency are also reported and discussed. These angular properties are relevant to the application of these solar devices in building integrated photovoltaics as potential window modules.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We show that the use of a periodic heat source, instead of a constant heat source, can improve the conversion efficiency of a thermoelectric power generator (TPG). A periodic heat source drives a periodic temperature difference across the thermoelectric with an amplitude Delta T. While the time average of Delta T is identical to the temperature difference under a constant heat source with equivalent energy input, the time average of (Delta T)(2) is larger, resulting in improved conversion efficiency. Here we present experimental measurements on a commercial thermoelectric device (bismuth telluride based) to validate analytical and numerical models. These models show that maximum efficiency is achieved when the period of the heat source is much larger than the thermal time constant of the TPG. Under this quasi-steady condition, the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT is still the relevant parameter for material optimization. A conventional thermoelectric material with ZT 1, operated with sinusoidal and square-wave heat sources (Delta T 100 K, T-Cold 300 K), can achieve 140% and 180% of the constant heat source efficiency; or otherwise stated, can perform like advanced materials with ZT of 1.6 and 2.8. Even greater improvement, inaccessible through materials-based ZT enhancements, can be achieved with low duty cycle heat sources.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A new composite structure of graphene-sulfur with a high electrochemical performance is proposed. Scotch-tape-like sulfur-assisted exfoliation of graphite is developed to produce the graphene-sulfur composites and freestanding low-defect graphene sheets. The intimate interaction between sulfur and graphene, attributed to the similar electronegativities of the two elements, is stronger than the van der Waals forces between adjacent p-p stacked graphene layers. This causes cleavage of the graphene layers when the sulfur molecules stick to the surface and edges of the graphite, similar to Scotch tape in micromechanical exfoliation processes. This approach enables us to obtain graphene with an electrical conductivity as high as 1820 S cm(-1) and a Hall mobility as high as 200 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), superior to most reported graphene. Furthermore, the graphene sheets which uniformly anchor sulfur molecules provide a superior confinement ability for polysulfides, sufficient space to accommodate sulfur volumetric expansion, a large contact area with the sulfur and a short transport pathway for both electrons and Li+. The unique structure containing 73 wt.% sulfur exhibits excellent overall electrochemical properties of 615 mA h g(-1) at the 1 C (1 C 1675 mA g(-1)) rate after 100 cycles (corresponding average Coulombic efficiency of over 96%) and 570 mA h g (-1) at 2 C. These encouraging results represent that sulfur molecules bound onto graphene sheets could be a promising cathode material for lithium batteries with a high energy density.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Bioelectrochemical systems encompass a range of electrochemical systems wherein microorganisms are used as biocatalysts. These range from classical microbial fuel cells to novel microbial electrosynthesis processes. The future of practical applications relies on increased performance. In all cases the development of new electrode materials is essential to overcome the low current densities of bioelectrochemical systems. Here we describe a new biocompatible, highly conductive three-dimensional scaffold electrode, NanoWeb-RVC, with a hierarchical porous structure, synthesized by direct growth of carbon nanotubes on a macroporous substrate. The nanostructure of these electrodes enhances the rate of bacterial extracellular electron transfer while the macrostructure ensures efficient mass transfer to and from the electrode surface. NanoWeb-RVC electrodes showed a current density of (6.8 +/- 0.3) mA cm(-2), almost three times higher than a control electrode with the same macroporous structure but lacking the nanostructure. This current density is among the highest reported to date for a microbial bioanode.</td>

Lithium-oxygen batteries (Li-O-2) have recently received great attention due to their large theoretical specific energy. Advantages of the aqueous design include the stability of the electrolyte, the long experience with gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), and the solubility of the reaction product lithium hydroxide. However, competitive specific energies can only be obtained if the product is allowed to precipitate. Here we present a dynamic one-dimensional model of a Li-O-2 battery including a GDE and precipitation of lithium hydroxide. The model is parameterized using experimental data from the literature. We demonstrate that GDEs remove power limitations due to slow oxygen transport in solutions and that lithium hydroxide tends to precipitate on the anode side. We discuss the system architecture to engineer where nucleation and growth predominantly occurs and to optimize for discharge capacity.</td>

We develop a Gibbs free energy function based on magnetic and calorimetric measurements that accounts for the magnetic behavior and martensitic phase transformation. The model predicts temperature and field induced phase transformations in agreement with experiments. The model is used to analyze a newly discovered method for the direct conversion of heat to electricity [Srivastava et al., Adv. Energy Mater., 2011, 1, 97], which is suited for the small temperature difference regime, about 10-100 K. Using the model, we explore the efficiency of energy conversion thermodynamic cycles based on this method. We also explore the implications of these predictions for future alloy development. Finally, we relate our simple free energy to more sophisticated theories that account for magnetic domains, demagnetization effects, the crystallography of martensitic phase transformations and twinning.</td>

As liquid phases, they are excellent monophasic reaction media for lipase-catalyzed methanolysis of triolein, resulting in fast and efficient biodiesel synthesis, e. g. up to 100% yield in 8 h at 60 degrees C, with exceptional enzyme stability (up to 1370 days half-life time at 60 degrees C). As solid phases, the reaction mixture can easily be fractionated by iterative centrifugations at controlled temperature into three phases, i.e. solid IL, glycerol and pure biodiesel. A straightforward and sustainable approach for producing biodiesel has been developed, allowing full recovery and reuse of the biocatalyst-IL system for successive cycles and suitable for scaling-up.</td>

Results so far confirm that the combustibility potential as well as the fire behaviour must be assessed on a case by case approach and is often dictated by the chemical structure of ionic liquids. The study also illustrates how the data obtained by our innovative procedure allow for consistent fire safety engineering studies serving the green use of ionic liquids in a contextual way. The work has opened a new perspective of collaborative work towards the development of a dedicated and pertinent methodology aiming at characterizing the comprehensive physicochemical hazard profiles of ionic liquids.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>For organic photovoltaics (OPVs) to become a viable source of renewable energy, the synthesis of organic active-layer materials will need to be scaled to thousands of kilograms. Additionally, the ultimate cost of these materials will need to be low enough to constitute only a small fraction of the cost of the solar cell module. In this study, we present a quantitative analysis, based on published small-scale synthetic procedures, to estimate the materials costs for several promising OPV materials when produced in large quantities. The cost in dollars-per-gram ($ per g) is found to increase linearly with the number of synthetic steps required to produce each organic photoactive compound. We estimate the cost-per-Watt ($ per W-p) as a function of power conversion efficiency (PCE) for an archetypal OPV structure and find that a relatively simple molecule requiring only 3 synthetic steps will contribute a cost of 0.001 to 0.01 $ per W-p, given a solar module PCE of 10%. In contrast, a relatively complicated molecule requiring 14 synthetic steps will contribute costs in the range of 0.075 to 0.48 $ per W-p. Our findings suggest that the commercial viability of an OPV technology may depend on the synthetic accessibility of its constituent active layer materials. Additionally, this work stresses the importance of optimizing synthetic routes to minimize solvent and reagent usage as well as to minimize the number of required workup procedures in the scaled production of OPV materials.</td>

In fact, inorganic solid electrolytes pave the way for improving the cost-effective development of rechargeable sodium batteries. This review describes a state-of-the-art overview of most of the Na+ conductors for use as electrolytes in sodium/sulphur and ZEBRA batteries. The emphasis of this article is on inorganic solid electrolytes, especially, ceramic and glass-ceramic electrolytes as promising alternatives applicable to all solid-state batteries. As part of a continuous effort to find new materials that operate at room temperature and moderate temperatures, NASICON electrolytes will also be considered. Polymer electrolytes based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) are also very suitable for all solid-state batteries.

Lithium-air/lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries have received extraordinary research attention recently owing to their potential to provide positive electrode gravimetric energies considerably higher (similar to 3 to 5x) than Li-ion positive electrodes, although the packaged device energy density advantage will be lower (similar to 2x). In light of the major technological challenges of Li-O-2 batteries, we discuss current understanding developed in non-carbonate electrolytes of Li-O-2 redox chemistry upon discharge and charge, oxygen reduction reaction product characteristics upon discharge, and the chemical instability of electrolytes and carbon commonly used in the oxygen electrode. We show that the kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction are influenced by catalysts at small discharge capacities (Li2O2 thickness less than similar to 1 nm), but not at large Li2O2 thicknesses, yielding insights into the governing processes during discharge. In addition, we discuss the characteristics of discharge products (mainly Li2O2) including morphological, electronic and surface features and parasitic reactivity with carbon. On charge, we examine the reaction mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction from Li2O2 and the influence of catalysts on bulk Li2O2 decomposition. These analyses provide insights into major discrepancies regarding Li-O-2 charge kinetics and the role of catalyst. In light of these findings, we highlight open questions and challenges in the Li-O-2 field relevant to developing practical, reversible batteries that achieve the anticipated energy density advantage with a long cycle life.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Conjugated polymers blended with nanocrystal quantum dots are interesting as solution processable active layers for infrared light harvesting in thin film solar cells. We study photocurrent generation processes in hybrid polymer/quantum dot photovoltaics by comparing device performance and photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectra across blends of three different conjugated polymers, poly(2,'-bis(2-(hexyldecyl)-quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-N-(2-hexyl-decyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d] pyrrole) (PDTPQx-HD), poly[(4,4'-bis(3-(2hexyl- decyl) dithieno[3,2-b: 2',3'-d] pyrrole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,5-bis(3-(2-ethyl-hexyl)thiophen-2yl)thiazolo[5,4-d] thiazole)] (PPEHTT), and poly[(4,4'-bis(2-octyl)dithieno[3,2-b: 2'3'-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,5-bis(3-octylthiophen-2yl) thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)] (PSOTT) with PbS quantum dots. The PIA spectra and device performance provide evidence for long-lived photoinduced charge separation and bulk heterojunction device operation for blends of both PDTPQx-HD and PPEHTT with PbS. In contrast we find that PSOTT/PbS blends can produce viable solar cells without any evidence for long-lived charge transfer in the PIA spectra. Even so, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSOTT/PbS solar cells indicate that the polymer plays a significant role in light harvesting. We use photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy to confirm that the polymer funnels energy to the PbS quantum dots via energy transfer, and speculate that these blends may operate as PbS Schottky diodes sensitized by energy transfer from the semiconducting polymer host.</td>

We analyze a wide variety of datasets to show that the shunt current exhibits a robust universal log-normal behavior for all these technologies. We affirm this conclusion by rigorous statistical analysis of the available data.

The catalyst was reusable and very stable. By XPS, C K-edge X-ray absorption spectra, benzene-TPD, and kinetic measurements, it was concluded that the moderate H2O2 activation rate, good benzene adsorption ability, and balanced kinetic control over the oxidation reaction are responsible for the outstanding catalytic performance of the metal-free catalyst.</td>

The current densities are higher by similar to 2.8 fold than a bulk polycrystalline copper electrode due to the enhanced surface area of the electroplated Cu(0) films. When combined, the two half reactions, catalyzed by Cu(II) and Cu(0), provide a basis for the net electrochemical splitting of CO2 into CO/HCOO- and O-2 in CO2/HCO3- buffered aqueous solutions.

We experimentally and theoretically investigated the piezoelectric potential drop in the ZnO NR-based NG due to the piezoelectric potential screening effect. A simple thermal annealing treatment was applied to the pristine ZnO NRs in air atmosphere to stabilize the output performance of the NG even in the presence of UV light. The piezoelectric output voltage from the surface-passivated NG was approximately 25 times higher than that from the NG with no passivation under UV light illumination.</td>

The effects of the porous structure and introduction of TiO2 on both the non-isothermal and isothermal hydrogen desorption-absorption properties of the porous system were systematically investigated. The results show significant improvements on both the kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrogen desorption-absorption of the porous CaB2H7-0.1TiO(2) system, compared with the dense Ca(BH4)(2). The desorption peak temperature is reduced by more than 50 degrees C and sorption capacity of ca. 5 wt% H-2 is rapidly achieved below 300 degrees C. The porous structure was retained in the dehydrogenated products, and rapid hydrogen absorption, approximately 80% of the desorption capacity, is obtained upon heating the product, post-dehydrogenated at 300 degrees C for 1 h, to 350 degrees C at 90 bar H-2. External addition of nano-TiO2 also enhances the hydrogen storage properties of Ca(BH4)(2), but to a lesser extent, compared with the synergetic effect of the porous structure and the in situ formed nano-TiO2. In addition, desorption-absorption mechanisms of the porous CaB2H7-0.1TiO(2) system are also proposed.</td>

In sharp contrast to Ru(II) sensitizers that employ functionalized thiophene appendages in their ancillary bipyridal ligands, the extended pi-conjugation introduced by the isoquinolinyl or quinolinyl groups improves the optical absorptivity, particularly for the absorption located at similar to 500 nm when compared with the parent sensitizer TFRS-1 possessing less conjugated 5-pyrid-2-yl pyrazolate ancillaries. As a result, DSCs incorporated with these dyes show much improved J(SC) compared with the reference device. Moreover, the use of bulky t-butyl substituents on the ancillary ligands improves the cell performance with excellent V-OC of up to 830 mV recorded. Also, the addition of tetra-n-butyl ammonium deoxycholate [TBA][DOC] as co-adsorbent to the dye solution further improves the power conversion efficiency (eta). The best solar cell parameters recorded were J(SC) = 16.3 mA cm(-2), V-OC = 860 mV, FF = 0.72, and eta = 10.1% for a device sensitized with TFRS-52. The markedly high open-circuit voltage is confirmed by the longer electron lifetime revealed in transient photovoltage (TPV) measurement versus the TFRS-1 sensitizer, and is probably derived from a combination of the higher conduction band edge of TiO2 induced by the in situ metathesis of carboxylate anchors and the reduced recombination contributed by the bulky sensitizer.</td>

The unique composition and structure of the carbons resulted in very promising electrochemical energy storage performance. We obtained a reversible lithium storage capacity of 1780 mA h g(-1), which is among the highest ever reported for any carbon-based electrode. Tested as a supercapacitor, the carbons exhibited a capacitance of 390 F g(-1), with an excellent cycle life (7% loss after 10 000 cycles). Such exquisite properties may be attributed to a unique combination of a high specific surface area, partial graphitization and very high bulk nitrogen content. It is a major challenge to derive carbons possessing all three attributes. By templating the structure of mesoporous cellular foam with egg white-derived proteins, we were able to obtain hierarchically mesoporous (pores centered at similar to 4 nm and at 20-30 nm) partially graphitized carbons with a surface area of 805.7 m(2) g(-1) and a bulk N-content of 10.1 wt%. When the best performing sample was heated in Ar to eliminate most of the nitrogen, the Li storage capacity and the specific capacitance dropped to 716 mA h g(-1) and 80 F g(-1), respectively.</td>

Herein, we address challenges in developing thick LbL electrodes of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) using conventional dip-and spray-LbL processes, and present a solution to overcome these challenges. The vacuum-assisted spray-LbL process using porous carbon substrates enabled a linear growth of LbL-MWNT electrodes with a 600 time decrease in their fabrication time. This result was attributed to the enhanced surface interactions between MWNTs and substrate via increased surface areas, enhanced capillary forces, physical entrapment in pores, and changes in hydrodynamic drag forces. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed high surface area carbon nanotube networks comprised of individual MWNT's. The spray MWNT electrodes delivered a high gravimetric energy of 100 W h kg(-1) at high gravimetric power of 50 kW kg(-1), which is higher than those of most carbon nanotube electrodes reported. Moreover, the spray MWNT electrodes delivered the highest energy capacity per unit area (up to 300 mu W h cm(-2) at 0.4 mW cm(-2) among the LbL electrodes reported, and showed excellent retention of energy capacity up to 100 mu W h cm(-2) at high power capacity of 200 mW cm(-2). These performance values are higher or comparable to the most advanced battery electrodes for high energy capacity per unit area.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>One of the key barriers to low cost biological conversion of cellulosic biomass into renewable fuels and chemicals is the recalcitrance of plants to deconstruction by chemical, enzymatic, and/or microbial routes. A deeper understanding of the source of biomass recalcitrance is sorely needed so that specific cell wall chemical and structural features that limit the release of sugars can be identified in different plants. In this study, biomass from two phylogenetically different plants, the monocot switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and the woody dicot poplar (Populus trichocarpa) were studied. Sets of samples that varied in composition and structure were generated from each native biomass via defined chemical and enzymatic extractions. The two native biomasses, as well as their extracted residues, were characterized, and the enzymatic digestibility of all samples was tested to shed light on substrate-related features that limit sugar release. Based on the results from this study, lignin and hemicellulose were found to influence the enzymatic digestibility of both poplar and switchgrass, but the degree of influence varied significantly. Xylan removal from switchgrass resulted in materials that achieved nearly 100% glucose yields at high enzyme loading in subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis, whereas chlorite extractions that reduced the lignin content had the most beneficial effect in poplar. While lignin content likely plays an important role in biomass recalcitrance particularly in plants such as poplar that contain higher levels of lignin, this work identified subsets of hemicellulose that were key recalcitrance-causing factors in switchgrass. The findings and research approach presented in this study strongly suggest that different strategies will need to be adopted when trying to engineer poplar and switchgrass for reduced recalcitrance or when designing processing conditions to efficiently convert a specific biomass feedstock into sugars.</td>

Considering the influence of a change in the temperature on the status of the precipitated nanofibrils until feeding it into the spray nozzle, the margin of the surviving nanofibrils at a certain temperature was also investigated. To verify the superiority of our strategy and present directions regarding its application to industry, arrays of organic solar cells based on a 3D non-woven nanofabric structure consisting of P3HT nanofibrils were designed and fabricated using our in situ process combined with a spray-coating system. As a result, through the in situ cooling process, a considerable solar energy harvesting efficiency near 4%, which is a state-of-the-art value in a bi-layer-based solar cell, was obtained.</td>

Moreover, a carbon nanotube content of 8-10 wt% does not compromise the low bulk thermal conductivity of the polymer matrix, which promises a high figure of merit of at least ZT &gt; 10(-2) at room-temperature.

It has been found that Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on N-doped graphene were partially reduced via Co3+(O-h) to Co2+(O-h), and the reduction varies spatially on and among individual Co3O4 nanocrystal-graphene sheets. Nitrogen sites on graphene have been shown to be major and important anchoring sites for Co3O4 nanocrystals in addition to the carbon and possibly oxygen sites. Macroscopic XANES of Co L-edge and K-edge were also measured to confirm the localized STXM result that Co3+ was partly reduced in the hybrid material.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this paper we demonstrate a technique for improving the conversion efficiency in conventional silicon solar cells by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects to harvest incident light energy over metal finger electrodes. According to three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) analysis, incident light covering a broad bandwidth of the solar spectrum can be transmitted through metallic hole array structures. Although the light absorption region beneath the metal finger electrodes cannot generate a photocurrent, in this study, we employ the extraordinary transmission (EOT) phenomenon, due to SPR effects, to dramatically increase the degree of light harvesting below the metal electrodes and, thereby, improve the efficiency of the entire solar cell. Experimental data reveal that the excess photocurrent density was approximately 190% of the normal current density of a standard solar cell. Therefore, the negative effect of covering the absorption area with opaque metal finger electrodes can be minimized or eliminated completely by taking advantage of the SPR effect of the metal electrodes.</td>

The formation of Mo2C is investigated by thermogravimetry and in situ X-ray diffraction. X-ray absorption analysis reveals that Mo2C nanoparticles are inlaid or anchored into the carbon supports, and the electronic modification makes the surface exhibit a relatively moderate Mo-H bond strength. It is found that carbon nanotube-supported Mo2C showed superior electrocatalytic activity and stability in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared to the bulk Mo2C. An overpotential of 63 mV for driving 1 mA cm(-2) of current density was measured for the nanotube-supported Mo2C catalysts; this exceeds the activity of analogous Mo2C catalysts. The enhanced electrochemical activity is facilitated by unique effects of the anchored structure coupled with the electronic modification.</td>

Out of the compounds investigated, a material with a hydrolyzed dithieno(3,2-b;2',3'-d)silole (SDT) core and 2-benzofuran (BFu) end capping groups leads to the most favorable properties for solar cells, capable of generating photocurrent up to 800 nm while producing an open-circuit voltage of over 850 mV, indicating a small loss in electrical potential compared to other bulk heterojunction systems.

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Accurate knowledge of water splitting kinetics is essential for the design and optimization of high-temperature thermochemical cycles for solar-driven fuel production, but such crucial data are unavailable for virtually all redox materials of potential practical value. We describe an investigation of the redox activity and oxidation kinetics of cobalt ferrite, a promising material for this application that is representative of a broader class of metal-substituted ferrites. To enable repetitive cycling, ferrites must be supported on another oxide to avoid sintering and deactivation. Consequently, we synthesized a composite material using atomic layer deposition of cobalt and iron oxides on zirconia, a commonly used ferrite "support", to create a well-controlled, uniformly distributed composition. Our results show that the support is not an innocent bystander and that dissolved iron within it reacts by a different mechanism than embedded iron oxide particles in the matrix. Samples were thermally reduced at 1450 degrees C under helium and oxidized with steam at realistic process temperatures ranging from 900 degrees C to 1400 degrees C. Experiments within a fluid-dynamically well-behaved stagnation-flow reactor, coupled with detailed numerical modelling of the transient H-2 production rates, allow us to effectively deconvolve experimental artefacts from intrinsic material behaviour over the entire time domain of the oxidation reaction. We find that second-order reaction and diffusion-limited mechanisms occur simultaneously at different oxidation rates and involve iron in two separate phases: (1) reduced Fe dissolved in the ZrO2 support and (2) iron oxide located at the interface between embedded ferrite particles and the zirconia matrix. Surprisingly, we also identified a catalytic mechanism occurring at the highest temperatures by which steady-state production of H-2 and O-2 occurs. The results reported here, which include Arrhenius rate constants for both oxidation mechanisms, will enable high-fidelity computational simulation of this complex, but promising approach to renewable fuel production.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Lithium based battery technologies are increasingly being considered for large-scale energy storage applications such as grid storage associated with wind and solar power installations. Safety and cost are very significant factors in these large scale devices. Ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes that are inherently nonvolatile and non-flammable offer a safer alternative to mainstream lithium battery electrolytes, which are typically based on volatile and flammable organic carbonates. Hence, in recent years there have been many investigations of ionic liquid electrolytes in lithium batteries with some highly promising results to date, however in most cases cost of the anion remains a significant impediment to widespread application. Amongst the various possible combinations the dicyanamide (DCA) anion based ionic liquids offer exceptionally low viscosities and high conductivities - highly desirable characteristics for Li electrolyte solvents. DCA ILs can be manufactured relatively inexpensively because DCA is already a commodity anion, containing only carbon and nitrogen, which is produced in large amounts for the pharmaceutical industry. In this study we use the non-fluorinated ionic liquid N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide to form non-volatile lithium battery electrolytes. We demonstrate good capacity retention for lithium metal and LiFePO4 in such electrolytes and discharge capacities above 130 mAh.g(-1) at 50 degrees C. We show that it is important to control moisture contents in this electrolyte system in order to reduce capacity fade and rationalise this observation using cyclic voltammetry and lithium symmetrical cell cycling. Having approximately 200 ppm of moisture content produces the optimum cycling ability. We also describe plastic crystal solid state electrolytes based on the DCA anion in the lithium metal-LiFePO4 battery configuration and demonstrate over 150 mAh.g(-1) discharge capacity without any significant capacity fading at 80 degrees C.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Valorization of native birch wood lignin into monomeric phenols over nickel-based catalysts has been studied. High chemoselectivity to aromatic products was achieved by using Ni-based catalysts and common alcohols as solvents. The results show that lignin can be selectively cleaved into propylguaiacol and propylsyringol with total selectivity &gt;90% at a lignin conversion of about 50%. Alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol, are suitable solvents for lignin conversion. Analyses with MALDI-TOF and NMR show that birch lignin is first fragmented into smaller lignin species consisting of several benzene rings with a molecular weight of m/z ca. 1100 to ca. 1600 via alcoholysis reaction. The second step involves the hydrogenolysis of the fragments into phenols. The presence of gaseous H-2 has no effect on lignin conversion, indicating that alcohols provide active hydrogen species, which is further confirmed by isotopic tracing experiments. Catalysts are recycled by magnetic separation and can be reused four times without losing activity. The mechanistic insights from this work could be helpful in understanding native lignin conversion and the formation of monomeric phenolics via reductive depolymerization.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Highly efficient photocatalysts for visible light-induced O-2 generation are synthesized via an electrostatically derived self-assembly of Zn-Cr-LDH 2D nanoplates with graphene 2D nanosheets. In the obtained nanohybrids, the positively charged Zn-Cr-LDH nanoplates are immobilized on the surface of negatively charged graphene nanosheets with the formation of a highly porous stacked structure. A strong electronic coupling of the subnanometer-thick Zn-Cr-LDH nanoplates with reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets gives rise not only to the prominent increase of visible light absorption but also to a remarkable depression of the photoluminescence signal. The self-assembled Zn-Cr-LDH-RGO nanohybrids display an unusually high photocatalytic activity for visible light-induced O-2 generation with a rate of similar to 1.20 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is far superior to that of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH material (similar to 0.67 mmol h(-1) g(-1)). The fact that pristine Zn-Cr-LDH is one of the most effective visible light photocatalysts for O-2 production with unusually high quantum efficiency of 61% at lambda = 410 nm highlights the excellent functionality of the Zn-Cr-LDH-RGO nanohybrids as visible light active photocatalysts. The Zn-Cr-LDH-RGO nanohybrid shows a higher photocatalytic activity than the Zn-Cr-LDH-GO nanohybrid, providing strong evidence for the superior advantage of the hybridization with RGO. The present findings clearly demonstrate that graphene nanosheets can be used as an effective platform for improving the photocatalytic activity of 2D nanostructured inorganic solids.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The synthesis of magnesium amidoborane, Mg(NH2BH3)(2) (MgAB), has been attracting considerable interest since the recognition of the potential of metal amidoboranes as promising hydrogen storage media. But so far, all the efforts for synthesizing Mg(NH2BH3)(2) using mechanochemical or wet chemistry methods have been frustrated. In this paper, we report a successful synthesis of MgAB using ammonia borane (AB) and magnesium hydride (MgH2) or magnesium (Mg) powder as starting materials. It was found that the post-milled 2AB/MgH2 and 2AB/Mg mixtures undergo solid-phase reactions under mild temperatures (&lt;= 70 degrees C), resulting in the formation of a new crystalline phase. A combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR), and solid-state B-11 MAS NMR characterizations, in conjunction with weight loss monitoring and the designed metathesis experiment, strongly indicates that the new crystalline phase is the long-sought MgAB. Our study using the solid-state B-11 NMR technique further revealed that the formation of MgAB involves a reaction mechanism that is distinct from other metal amidoboranes. MgH2 or Mg may actually react with the mobile phase of AB (AB*), rather than with the starting normal AB. The examination of its properties revealed that MgAB is a stable compound at room temperature and can release similar to 10 wt% H-2 of high purity at temperature below 300 degrees C, suggesting that it is a promising hydrogen storage material.</td>

Under reasonable assumption, the mathematical model developed enables the observation that the performance characteristic of the cells charged with a constant power input differentiates between the various current-charge waveforms, with cell geometry and electrode kinetics playing subtle, but significant, roles; in particular, high efficiency is observed for sunlight-charged batteries which are thin and suffer no corrosion of the sacrificial electrode, and which have already experienced a charge-discharge cycle. The performance characteristics of the systems are interpreted in the light of consequences for smart grid realisation, and indicate that, for a constant power input, the most matched renewable is biofuel burning with a current output that linearly increases with time.</td>

(The purpose of their article was to evaluate the contention that the accident would have no health effects.) As a result, the projection by TH&amp;J of 125 future cancer-related mortalities worldwide (range 15 to 1100) appears to be an underestimate. Some other factors in their calculation tended to overestimate consequences. On balance, the net result of adjusting the TH&amp;J numbers to account for long-term dose from radiocesium is uncertain, but the mid-range estimate for the number of future mortalities is probably closer to 1000 than to 125.</td>

This review focuses on recent developments of some promising photoelectrode materials, such as BiVO4, a-Fe2O3, TaON, and Ta3N5 for solar hydrogen production. Some strategies have been developed to improve PEC performances of the photoelectrode materials, including: (i) doping for enhancing visible light absorption in the wide bandgap semiconductor or promoting charge transport in the narrow bandgap semiconductor, respectively; (ii) surface treatment for removing segregation phase or surface states; (iii) electrocatalysts for decreasing the overpotentials; (iv) morphology control for enhancing the light absorption and shortening transfer distance of minority carriers; (v) other methods, such as sensitization, passivating layer, and band structure engineering using heterojunction structures, and so on. Photochemical durability of the photoelectrodes is also discussed, since any potential PEC technology must balance efficiency against cost and photochemical durability. Photochemical durability may be amended by optimizing the photoelectrode, electrocatalyst, and electrolyte at the same time. In addition, solar seawater splitting is briefly introduced because it has received attention recently. Finally, trends in research in PEC cells for solar hydrogen production are detailed.</td>

It also discusses gold loading methods, comparing them in terms of simplicity, efficiency and the resultant particle size and dispersion of Au over various supports. The application of different types of supporting materials is also presented, with a critical discussion of the parameters affecting the choice and use of such materials, i.e. how the support interacts with gold particles and with pollutant molecules along with the advantages a support offers to VOC oxidation and WGS reactions.

With performance comparable to those of amorphous silicon TFTs, and with improved material stability, one can realistically envision promising future applications of these polymers. In reviewing the development of conjugated semiconducting polymers, two particularly interesting and significant observations are made. First, most of these high-performance materials are donor-acceptor polymers; and second, high mobilities of above 1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) generally involve donor-acceptor polymers with strongly electron accepting moieties. The present perspective covers these latter polymers.

In addition to reviewing some recent PEC research on hematite and its relevant physical and chemical characteristics, we show how hematite obtained by a low cost synthesis can be refined by hydrothermal treatment and further functionalized by coating with phycocyanin, a light harvesting protein known for photosynthesis in blue-green algae.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Increasing demand for fuels and chemicals, driven by factors including over-population, the threat of global warming and the scarcity of fossil resources, strains our resource system and necessitates the development of sustainable and innovative strategies for the chemical industry. Our society is currently experiencing constraints imposed by our resource system, which drives industry to increase its overall efficiency by improving existing processes or finding new uses for waste. Food supply chain waste emerged as a resource with a significant potential to be employed as a raw material for the production of fuels and chemicals given the abundant volumes globally generated, its contained diversity of functionalised chemical components and the opportunity to be utilised for higher value applications. The present manuscript is aimed to provide a general overview of the current and most innovative uses of food supply chain waste, providing a range of worldwide case-studies from around the globe. These studies will focus on examples illustrating the use of citrus peel, waste cooking oil and cashew shell nut liquid in countries such as China, the UK, Tanzania, Spain, Greece or Morocco. This work emphasises 2nd generation food waste valorisation and re-use strategies for the production of higher value and marketable products rather than conventional food waste processing (incineration for energy recovery, feed or composting) while highlighting issues linked to the use of food waste as a sustainable raw material. The influence of food regulations on food supply chain waste valorisation will also be addressed as well as our society's behavior towards food supply chain waste. "There was no ways of dealing with it that have not been known for thousands of years. These ways are essentially four: dumping it, burning it, converting it into something that can be used again, and minimizing the volume of material goods - future garbage - that is produced in the first place." William Rathje on waste (1945-2012) - Director of the Tucson Garbage project.</td>

The component responsible for corrosion of magnesium electrolytes has not been previously elucidated. Here we clarify that chlorides in the cation (Mg-2(mu-Cl)(3)center dot 6THF)(+) are a major culprit for corrosion. We also corroborate the feasibility of ion exchange reactions as a suitable synthetic approach towards magnesium electrolytes which do not contain the cation (Mg-2(mu-Cl)(3)center dot 6THF)(+). Our results indicate that magnesium organoborates are an interesting class of magnesium electrolytes which undergo magnesium deposition and dissolution and are non-corrosive in nature at high voltages.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We report a facile approach to perform post-growth doping of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanostructures by depositing titanium (Ti) precursor solution and subsequent annealing in air. Using hematite nanowire photoanodes on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates as a model system, the doping conditions were carefully optimized and highly photoactive hematite photoanodes were prepared at a more practically acceptable temperature of 650-700 degrees C than the &gt;= 800 degrees C commonly used in previous works. A combination of microstructural characterization, elemental analysis, photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis were employed to confirm the distribution of Ti atoms in hematite nanostructures and the role of Ti dopants in enhancing the photocurrent of hematite photoanodes. It was found that the Ti-treatment increases the donor concentration of hematite by about 10 fold and facilitates majority carrier transport and collection, which may account for the performance enhancement. Moreover, EIS measurements under illumination and Mott-Schottky analysis clearly showed that Ti dopants interact with the surface trap states of hematite, suggesting that surface passivation may also contribute to the improved PEC performance. This facile post-growth doping method can be applied to other hematite nanostructures such as electrochemically deposited hematite films and expanded to other dopants such as zirconium (Zr).</td>

Since the size of the nanofibrils is much less than the wavelength of visible light, nanopaper is highly transparent with large light scattering in the forward direction. Successful depositions of transparent and conductive materials including tin-doped indium oxide, carbon nanotubes and silver nanowires have been achieved on nanopaper substrates, opening up a wide range of applications in optoelectronics such as displays, touch screens and interactive paper.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Lithium-O-2 cells can be considered the "holy grail" of lithium batteries because they offer much superior theoretical energy density to conventional lithium-ion systems. In this study, porous carbon-supported MnO2 nanorods synthesized at room temperature were explored as an electrocatalyst for rechargeable Li-O-2 cells. Both high-energy X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine-structure analyses showed that the prepared MnO2 exhibited a tetragonal crystal structure (alpha-MnO2), which has proved to be one of the most efficient catalysts to facilitate the charging of the Li-O-2 cell. Under the current synthetic approach, alpha-MnO2 was uniformly distributed onto the surface of a carbon support, without disrupting the porous structure at the surface of the carbon cathode. As a result, the as-prepared catalysts demonstrated good electrochemical behavior, with a capacity of similar to 1400 mA h g(-1) (carbon + electrocatalyst) under a current density of 100 mA g(-1) (carbon + electrocatalyst) during the initial discharge. The charge potential was significantly reduced, to 3.5-3.7 V, compared with most of the reported data, which are above 4.0 V. The mechanism of the capacity fade with cycling was also investigated by analyzing the cathode at different states of discharge-charge by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.</td>

Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared resonance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the composite membranes. The effects of the molar ratio of monomers in the aqueous phase and the concentrations of monomers in both the aqueous phase and the organic phase were investigated to obtain higher permselectivity. For CO2/N-2 gas mixture (15/85 by volume), the optimized membrane displays a CO2 permeance of 5831 GPU and CO2/N-2 selectivity of 86 at 0.11 MPa feed pressure. Moreover, the membrane shows excellent antioxidizability and acid resistance. Finally, the economic evaluation of the membranes prepared in this work for flue gas separation was carried out. A two-stage membrane system using the membrane prepared in this work shows cost-competition compared with the traditional chemical absorption method.</td>

Among the investigated compounds, Bi2Te2S1 shows a peak ZT similar to 0.8 at 300 degrees C and Bi2Se1S2 similar to 0.8 at 500 degrees C. The results show that these compounds can be used for mid-temperature power generation applications. The leg efficiency of thermoelectric conversion for segmented elements based on these n-type materials could potentially reach 12.5% with a cold side at 25 degrees C and a hot side at 500 degrees C if appropriate p-type legs are paired, which could compete well with the state-of-the-art n-type materials within the same temperature range, including lead tellurides, lead selenides, lead sulfides, filled-skutterudites, and half Heuslers.</td>

It has been found that the morphologies of natural hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanocrystals have large variations depending on thermodynamic and chemical conditions of their formation environments. To assess the applicability of nanomorphology as an environmental indicator, we construct a morphology map of hematite nanocrystals in hydrous environments, characterized with different temperatures, humidity and supersaturation of oxygen. Our model indicates that the fractional surface areas of morphologically significant facets change with humidity and temperature, and can be used to track the variation of these environmental conditions.</td>

Here we focus on fully dense electrical insulators at the low end of the spectrum of lattice thermal conductivity k(L). We present an experimentally validated predictive tool that shows how the high deformability of lone-pair electron charge density can limit k(L) in crystalline materials. Using first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we predict that several ABX(2) (groups I-V-VI2) compounds based on the rocksalt structure develop soft phonon modes due to the strong hybridization and repulsion between the lone-pair electrons of the group V cations and the valence p orbitals of group VI anions. In many cases, this creates lattice instabilities and the compounds either do not exist or crystallize in a different structure. Marginally stable ABX(2) compounds have anharmonic bonds that result in strong phonon-phonon interactions. We show experimentally how these can reduce k(L) to the amorphous limit.</td>

Electrolysis experiments at a fixed applied potential of 1.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) established that the NiOx-en films sustain a stable current of 1.8 mA cm(-2) for extended periods, compared with 1.2 mA cm(-2) for films derived from [Ni(OH2)(6)](NO3)(2) and [Ni(NH3)(6)]Cl-2 when tested in a 0.60 M NaBi buffer. XAS studies indicate that the gamma-NiOOH phase is formed in each case whereas SEM studies revealed significant differences in film morphology. The NiOx-en films were found to be more homogenous and to have a higher electroactive surface area, as determined from capacitance measurements. The results highlight the influence that the choice of molecular precursor can have on the activity and robustness of electrodeposited NiOx water oxidation catalysts.</td>

Crumbling/sulfation is the main failure mechanism of the active materials, which limits their cycle life. LA batteries possessing long cycle life can serve as an ideal energy storage technology for load leveling applications. By uniformly adding properly oxidized CNTs to the positive active material of LA batteries, we achieved a pronounced improvement in their cycle life. This improvement was mainly attained by the formation of a stable conductive grid that enabled the delivery of current to all the active material. The grid consisted of composites made of CNTs conformably coated with lead salts. By enabling a uniform electron distribution, and subsequently proper electrochemical redox reactions, the formation of too big PbSO4 particles did not occur, thus changing the failure mechanism from crumbling/sulfation to pure crumbling. Additionally, the perfect coating of the CNTs prevented their electrochemical oxidation to CO or CO2. This improvement in cycle life is significant and extends the importance of LA batteries beyond their traditional applications.</td>

Two model electrochemically active biofilms, Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, were investigated. A novel nuclear magnetic resonance microimaging perfusion probe capable of simultaneous electrochemical and pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) techniques was used. PFG-NMR allowed for noninvasive, nondestructive, high spatial resolution in situ D-e measurements in living biofilms respiring on electrodes. The electrodes were polarized so that they would act as the sole terminal electron acceptor for microbial metabolism. We present our results as both two-dimensional D-e heat maps and surface-averaged relative effective diffusion coefficient (D-rs) depth profiles. We found that (1) D-rs decreases with depth in G. sulfurreducens biofilms, following a sigmoid shape; (2) D-rs at a given location decreases with G. sulfurreducens biofilm age; (3) average D-e and D-rs profiles in G. sulfurreducens biofilms are lower than those in S. oneidensis biofilms-the G. sulfurreducens biofilms studied here were on average 10 times denser than the S. oneidensis biofilms; and (4) halting the respiration of a G. sulfurreducens biofilm decreases the D-e values. Density, reflected by D-e, plays a major role in the extracellular electron transfer strategies of electrochemically active biofilms.</td>

The incorporation of layered titanate nanosheets into the Pt-RGO nanocomposite induces a marked increase of surface area through the frustration of a strong pi-pi interaction between RGO nanosheets by the intervention of titanate nanosheets. In addition, the incorporation of layered titanate nanosheets gives rise to a remarkable improvement of electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Of prime importance is that the present nanocomposites show a more positive onset potential for ORR than commercial Pt/carbon catalysts, underscoring a powerful role of titanate nanosheets in optimizing the electrocatalyst performance of Pt-RGO nanocomposites. This is the first report showing the usefulness of metal oxide nanosheets as an effective additive for enhancing the electrocatalyst performance of platinum nanoparticles. The observed enhancement of electrocatalytic activity upon the addition of titanate nanosheets is attributable to the decrease of Pt crystal size, the increase of surface area, and the increase of surface hydrophilicity. The present findings clearly demonstrate that the incorporation of layered titanate nanosheets is quite effective in improving the electrocatalytic functionality of Pt-RGO nanocomposites.</td>

Moreover, the lithium ion transference in the gel membrane at room temperature is almost twice that in the commercial separator. Furthermore, the absorbed solvent is difficult to evaporate at elevated temperature. Its electrochemical performance is evaluated by using a LiFePO4 cathode.

The nanoparticles were then assembled on an Au surface to form a film with high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A Tafel slope of 69 mV per decade was measured for this film and the onset potential was estimated to be -0.09 V. The small loading (1.03 mu g cm(-2)) and the high current density (0.92 mA cm(-2) at eta = 0.15 V) demonstrated extremely high catalytic efficiency. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic results revealed that the assembled nanoparticle film was sulfur enriched with abundant S edges and a structural rearrangement of the S rich particles might occur during the self-assembly process, resulting in significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for HER. Electrochemical impedance measurements suggested that the assembling process optimized the conductivity of the nanoparticle film, which contributed to the enhanced HER catalytic activity. Our research has provided a new way to synthesize active molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles for HER and a new approach to achieve enrichment of S edges on molybdenum sulfide, which might have potential use not only for electrocatalytic HER, but also for photoelectrocatalytic HER and plasmon-enhanced water splitting.</td>

ALD's epitaxial growth mechanism allowed the control of the morphology and thickness of the hematite films as well as the concentration and distribution of Ti atoms. The photoelectrochemical performances of Ti-doped and undoped hematite electrodes were examined and compared under water oxidation conditions. The incorporation of Ti atoms into hematite electrodes was found to dramatically enhance the water oxidation performance, with much greater enhancement found for the thinnest films. An optimum concentration similar to 3 atomic% of Ti atoms was also determined. A series of electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and impedance spectroscopy measurements were employed to elucidate the cause of the improved photoactivity of the Ti-doped hematite thin films. This performance enhancement was a combination of improved bulk properties (hole collection length) and surface properties (water oxidation efficiency). The improvement in both bulk and surface properties is attributed to the resurrection of a dead layer by the Ti dopant atoms.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Capacitive reverse electrodialysis (CRED) is a newly proposed technology to generate electricity from mixing of salt water and fresh water (salinity gradient energy) by using a membrane pile as in reverse electrodialysis (RED) and capacitive electrodes. The salinity difference between salt water and fresh water generates a potential difference over ion selective membranes, which can be used as a renewable power source. The strength and unique characteristic of CRED in comparison to the other technologies is that it allows multiple membrane cells between a single set of electrodes and at the same time avoids redox reactions using capacitive electrodes. The capacitive electrodes use activated carbon on a support of Ti/Pt mesh to store ions and their charge. A periodic switching of the feed waters, combined with a switching of the direction of the electric current, ensures that the capacitive electrodes do not get saturated. The large membrane pile enables the electrodes to be charged more than in previous approaches for capacitive mixing. As a consequence, the energy cycle of CRED has a larger range in both voltage and accumulated charge compared to previous capacitive mixing technologies. The power density obtainable with CRED stacks with capacitive electrodes is an order of magnitude higher than in previous attempts for capacitive energy extraction and close to or even better than similar RED stacks with conventional redox based electrode systems. CRED is considered to be a stable, safe, clean and high performing technology to obtain energy from mixing of salt water and fresh water.</td>

In this synthesis, the ionic liquid acts both as a structure directing agent and a heteroatom precursor. The obtained porous carbons have a specific surface area lower than 376 m(2) g(-1) and thus a high skeleton density. With such heteroatom doped skeleton structures and fully interconnected macropores, mesopores and micropores, the hierarchically porous carbon shows outstanding electrochemical performance, e.g. a superior high gravimetric capacitance (C-g) of 247 F g(-1), an interfacial capacitance (C-S) of 66 mu F cm(-2) (calculated based on the discharge curve with a constant current density of 0.5 A g(-1)), whilst a high volumetric capacitance (C-v) of 101 F cm(-3) compared to those reported in the literature. Cycling stability tests indicate that the carbon exhibits a capacitance retention of similar to 96.2% after 4000 charge-discharge cycles, strongly reflecting an excellent long-term cyclability of the electrode. Due to its unique skeleton structure and high conductivity, such hierarchically porous carbon shows promise as an electrode material for supercapacitors.</td>

A yeast display system in Saccharomyces cerevisae was used to screen several carbonic anhydrase isoforms and mineralization peptides for their impact on CO2 hydration, CaCO3 mineralization, and particle settling rate. Enhanced rates for each of these steps in the CaCO3 mineralization process were confirmed using quantitative techniques in lab-scale measurements. The effect of these enhanced rates on the CO2 capture cost in an industrial scale CO2 mineralization process using coal fly ash as the CaO source was evaluated. The model predicts a process using bCA2-yeast and fly ash is similar to 10% more cost effective per tonne of CO2 captured than a process with no biological molecules, a savings not realized by wild-type yeast and high-temperature stable recombinant CA2 alone or in combination. The levelized cost of electricity for a power plant using this process was calculated and scenarios in which this process compares favourably to CO2 capture by MEA absorption process are presented.</td>

As an example, the EU requirements for 20% of final energy to be derived from renewable sources by 2020 feeds in to a UK target for renewable energy to make up 15% of UK final energy demand by 2020; the implications of this are investigated and found to have global repercussions. In order to achieve the UK target it is essential that the existing strategies for delivering wind power and coupling it to the grid are successful but there is an additional, greater, challenge. A large part of the UK renewables target will need to be met by the use of biomass and we show here that the amounts of biomass needed far exceed the supply capacity of the UK; imports will dominate the supply. The imports required are far greater than present day UK imports of coal with substantial potential implications; globally for biomass markets with potential impact on food supply and deforestation, and locally for UK infrastructure in shipping, ports, rail, road freight, electricity transmission networks and the coal industry. The way that a single country's response to a regional energy strategy can have global implications are investigated using one reference scenario for future UK fuel needs as an example. A strong outcome is that to implement this level of rapid change in the energy supply chain whilst avoiding negative impacts in a rapidly expanding global market there is a need for synchronisation of policies across economies as a whole, including anticipated effects beyond national borders, rather than policy measures in separate, isolated areas such as energy.</td>

These are CO2 capture using: (i) chilled ammonia, (ii) alkali-metal carbonates, (iii) membranes and (iv) calcium looping. These four technologies are compared to the benchmark monoethanolamine (MEA) scrubbing process in terms of efficiency penalty and cost indicators. We first review the relevant CO2 capture chemistry and typical process flow schematics, and then discuss energy- and mass-balance considerations. We consider 18 published techno-economic studies on these technologies and highlight the key measures, including net CO2 capture rate, net power output, net plant efficiency, capital costs, cost of electricity and cost of CO2 avoided. Calcium looping technology results in the lowest efficiency penalty (4.6%-points) and cost of PCC (36.3% increase in levelised cost of electricity). In addition, the cost of CO2 avoided by employing calcium looping for PCC can be as low as 29 USD2010 per tCO(2). On all three of these criteria, calcium looping performs more than twice as well as the benchmark MEA PCC process.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted great interest as potential candidates of "low cost solar cells" in the solution of global energy demand. To accelerate the progress of DSCs, it is important to evaluate device performance with reliable measurements that will enable more effective comparison and application of new findings in materials and technologies by different research groups. In this perspective, we review existing measurement methods and summarize the appropriate techniques for the evaluation of DSCs based mainly on our experience, which helped us to obtain reliable results close to those certified by public test centres. The key factors in the measurements that correlate to device performance are discussed, including the calibration of the solar simulator using reference cells, the measurement time of the current-voltage characteristics and the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency, and the area for determination with a proper shading mask. We demonstrate the causes and solutions of measurement errors in the results of device performance, such as short circuit photocurrent density, open circuit voltage, fill factor, and energy conversion efficiency. Finally, a list of appropriate measurements for a more reliable evaluation of DSCs is proposed.</td>

Two lobsters with implanted biofuel cells connected in series were able to generate open circuit voltage (V-oc) up to 1.2 V and an electrical watch, selected as a model electronic device, was activated by the power extracted from the "living battery". The fluidic system composed of five cells filled with human serum solution connected in series generated V-oc of ca. 3 V and was able to power a pacemaker. Sustainable operation of the pacemaker was achieved with the system closely mimicking human physiological conditions characteristic of normal and pathophysiological glucose concentrations with the fluidic rate typical for a blood circulation upon resting or performing physical exercises. While the "cyborg" lobsters demonstrate a model system with future possible military, homeland security and environmental monitoring applications, the system activating a pacemaker presents practicality for biomedical applications. The first demonstration of the pacemaker activated by the physiologically produced electrical energy shows promise for future electronic implantable medical devices powered by electricity harvested from the human body.</td>

A SPENG with carrier-controlled ZnO NWs exhibits excellent energy harvesting characteristics with an average power density of 0.9 mW cm(-3), as well as a near 50 fold increase in both output voltage and current compared to those of a conventional ZnO NW. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that an optimized SPENG is large enough and very suitable to drive electrophoretic ink displays based on voltage-drive systems. This fundamental progress makes it possible to fabricate high performance nanogenerators for viable industrial applications in portable/wearable personal electronics such as electronic papers and smart identity cards.</td>

An improvement in short circuit current was observed by adjusting the concentration of polyethylene glycol in the aqueous electrolyte, which is attributed to better diffusion of the redox mediator within the electrolyte. Replacement of platinum with a composite ITO/platinum counter electrode material results in a further increase in energy conversion efficiency to above 5%. Electrochemical impedance measurements indicate a dramatic decrease in charge transport resistance at the interface between the counter electrode and aqueous electrolyte when ITO/Pt was used. Moreover, significantly improved device stability over previously reported water based DSCs under 1 sun illumination suggests that cobalt(II)/(III) tris(2,2'-bipyridine) is a promising redox mediator for highly efficient aqueous dye-sensitized solar cells.</td>

Among the zeolites tested, Ca-A exhibits the highest CO2 uptake (3.72 mmol g(-1) and 5.63 mmol cm(-3)) together with an excellent CO2 selectivity over N-2 under conditions relevant to capture from the dry flue gas stream of a coal-fired power plant. The large initial isosteric heat of adsorption of -58 kJ mol(-1) indicates the presence of strong interactions between CO2 and the Ca-A framework. Neutron and X-ray powder diffraction studies reveal the precise location of the adsorption sites for CO2 in Ca-A and Mg-A. A detailed study of CO2 adsorption kinetics further shows that the performance of Ca-A is not limited by slow CO2 diffusion within the pores. Significantly, Ca-A exhibited a higher volumetric CO2 uptake and CO2/N-2 selectivity than Mg-2(dobdc) (dobdc(4-) = 1,4-dioxido-2,5-benzenedicarboxylate; Mg-MOF-74, CPO-27-Mg), one of the best performing adsorbents. The exceptional performance of Ca-A was maintained in CO2 breakthrough simulations.</td>

In this paper we deploy 4-hexylphenyl substituted cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b'] dithiophene[2',1':4,5] thieno[2,3-d]thiophene as the pi-linker of a D-pi-A dye, which displays an improved molar absorption coefficient and a red-shifted absorption peak in contrast to its model dye with the 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene segment. The energy-gap reduction is concomitant with negative and positive shifts of ground-state and excited-state redox potentials, which however do not exert an adverse impact on the net charge separation yield at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface, probably due to the formation of a favored microstructured dye assembly. Furthermore, the dye load amount can be tuned by changing the bath solvent and has a significant influence on some key photovoltaic features such as the photocurrent and photovoltage, the latter of which is dissected via the joint charge extraction and photovoltage decay experiments. The charge recombination lifetime could be roughly rationalized by analyzing the damping of signals on emitted electrons from titania in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements.</td>

The Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) superionic conductor has the highest Li+ conductivity reported to date, with excellent electrochemical performance demonstrated in a Li-ion rechargeable battery. Our results show that isovalent cation substitutions of Ge4+ have a small effect on the relevant intrinsic properties, with Li10SiP2S12 and Li10SnP2S12 having similar phase stability, electrochemical stability and Li+ conductivity as LGPS. Aliovalent cation substitutions (M = Al or P) with compensating changes in the Li+ concentration also have a small effect on the Li+ conductivity in this structure. Anion substitutions, however, have a much larger effect on these properties. The oxygen-substituted Li10MP2O12 compounds are predicted not to be stable (with equilibrium decomposition energies &gt;90 meV per atom) and have much lower Li+ conductivities than their sulfide counterparts. The selenium-substituted Li10MP2Se12 compounds, on the other hand, show a marginal improvement in conductivity, but at the expense of reduced electrochemical stability. We also studied the effect of lattice parameter changes on the Li+ conductivity and found the same asymmetry in behavior between increases and decreases in the lattice parameters, i.e., decreases in the lattice parameters lower the Li+ conductivity significantly, while increases in the lattice parameters increase the Li+ conductivity only marginally. Based on these results, we conclude that the size of the S2- is near optimal for Li+ conduction in this structural framework.</td>

This new type of NG has a very high sensitivity and mechanical durability with fully flexible, rollable, stretchable, foldable, and twistable properties.

Upon exposure to the same input sound pressure, the measured output performance of the stretchable NG with a thin polydimethylsiloxane stretchable rubber template is up to 30 times that of a normal NG with a plastic substrate. Upon exposure to an air flow at the same speed, the measured output voltage from the stretchable NG is about 8 times larger than that of the normal NG.</td>

To combat the solubility of polysulphides, confinement approaches aiming to trap sulphur within the cathode side have been pursued, but success has been limited. Herein, we drastically deviate from this approach and use a liquid cathode obtained either by dissolving polysulphides within the electrolyte or by placing sulphur powders in contact with the Li negative electrode. Such approaches are shown to result in greater performance than confinement approaches. Such a strategy eliminates the detrimental Li2S formation inside a porous carbon matrix and moreover leads to the formation of a protective SEI layer at the Li electrode, as deduced by impedance spectroscopy and XPS, which seems beneficial to the cell cycling performance.</td>

We thus investigate a series of working dye sensitizers and prototypical surface adsorbers and apply an innovative approach to disentangle electrostatic and charge-transfer effects occurring at the crucial dye-TiO2 interface. We clearly demonstrate that an extensive charge rearrangement accompanies the dye-TiO2 interaction, which amounts to transfer of up to 0.3-0.4 electrons from the dyes bound in a dissociative mode to the semiconductor. Molecular monodentate adsorption leads to a much smaller CT. We also find that the amount of CT is modulated by the dye donor groups, with the coumarin dyes showing a stronger CT. A subtle modulation of the semiconductor conduction band edge energy is found by varying the nature of the dye, in line with the experimental data from the literature obtained by capacitance and open circuit voltage measurements. We then decompose the total conduction band shift into contributions directly related to the sensitizer properties, considering the effect of the electric field generated by the dye on the semiconductor conduction band. This effect, which amounts to ca. 40% of the total shift, shows a linear correlation with the TiO2 conduction band shifts. A direct correlation between the dye dipole and the observed conduction band shift is retrieved only for dyes of similar structure and dimensions. We finally found a near-exact proportionality between the amount of charge transfer and the residual contribution to the conduction band shift, which may be as large as 60% of the total shift. The present findings constitute the basis for obtaining a deeper understanding of the crucial interactions taking place at the dye-semiconductor interface, and establish new design rules for dyes with improved DSC functionality.</td>

TEM observations reveal a uniform distribution of the Fe2O3 nanoparticle size and preferential nuclei growth along the edge defects. Both graphene and its Fe2O3 nanocomposites are prepared as electrochemical electrodes to evaluate their capacitor performances. Under normal conditions (without a magnetic field), the MGNCs show lower capacitance than graphene due to the large particle loading (52.5 wt%), which brings larger internal resistance and thus prevents efficient electron transportation within the electrodes. However, in the presence of an external magnetic field, both graphene and MGNC electrodes exhibit significantly enhanced capacitance as compared to the results obtained under normal conditions. Specifically, the capacitance of graphene is increased by 67.1 and 26.8% at the sweeping rates of 2 and 10 mV s(-1), respectively. Even larger enhancements of 154.6 and 98.2% were observed in MGNCs at the same sweeping rates of 2 and 10 mV s(-1), respectively. The energy density and power density of the electroactive materials are also dramatically enhanced in the presence of a magnetic field. Equivalent circuit modeling of impedance spectra revealed that the magnetic field played a critical role in restricting the interfacial relaxation process and thus enhanced the electrode capacitance. These findings present a potential revolution of traditional electrochemical capacitors by simply applying an external magnetic field to enhance the capacitance dramatically (even doubling it depending on the electroactive materials) without material replacement and structural modification.</td>

This process can be tuned to adjust the size of the liquid alkanes. In the first step furfural is produced from the acid-catalyzed dehydration of hemicellulose-derived sugar streams in a biphasic reactor. The second step is the aldol condensation of furfural with acetone in a THF solvent and using a NaOH catalyst to produce highly conjugated C-13 compounds along with some oligomeric adducts formed through Michael addition reactions. These compounds are then hydrogenated with a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst forming both the fully hydrogenated form of the C-13 oligomers and also forming larger oligomers by Diels-Alder reactions. The extent of Diels-Alder reactions can be tuned by changing the temperature and feed concentration, thereby adjusting the distribution of liquid alkanes that can be produced. The final step in this process is hydrodeoxygenation using a Pt/SiO2-Al2O3 bifunctional catalyst to produce the liquid alkanes. A simple biorefinery model has shown that about 55% of a furfural-acetone mixture (10 : 3 wt ratio) can be converted into cycle oils while also producing other refinery products such as gasoline and natural gas.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Microbial electrosynthesis is a promising strategy for the microbial conversion of carbon dioxide to transportation fuels and other organic commodities, but optimization of this process is required for commercialization. Cathodes which enhance electrode-microbe electron transfer might improve rates of product formation. To evaluate this possibility, biofilms of Sporomusa ovata, which are effective in acetate electrosynthesis, were grown on a range of cathode materials and acetate production was monitored over time. Modifications of carbon cloth that resulted in a positive-charge enhanced microbial electrosynthesis. Functionalization with chitosan or cyanuric chloride increased acetate production rates 6-7 fold and modification with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane gave rates 3-fold higher than untreated controls. A 3-fold increase in electrosynthesis over untreated carbon cloth cathodes was also achieved with polyaniline cathodes. However, not all strategies to provide positively charged surfaces were successful, as treatment of carbon cloth with melamine or ammonia gas did not stimulate acetate electrosynthesis. Treating carbon cloth with metal, in particular gold, palladium, or nickel nanoparticles, also promoted electrosynthesis, yielding electrosynthesis rates that were 6-,4.7- or 4.5-fold faster than the untreated control, respectively. Cathodes comprised of cotton or polyester fabric treated with carbon nanotubes yielded cathodes that supported acetate electrosynthesis rates that were similar to 3-fold higher than carbon cloth controls. Recovery of electrons consumed in acetate was similar to 80% for all materials. The results demonstrate that one approach to increase rates of carbon dioxide reduction in microbial electrosynthesis is to modify cathode surfaces to improve microbe-electrode interactions.</td>

Here we explore the functionality of EDLC microporous carbon electrodes using a combination of classical electrochemical measurements and scanning probe microscopy based dilatometry, thus separating individual stages in charge/discharge processes based on strain generation. These methods allowed us to observe two distinct modes of EDLC charging, one fast charging of the double layer unassociated with strain, and another much slower mass transport related charging exhibiting significant sample volume changes. These studies open the pathway for the exploration of electrochemical systems with multiple processes involved in the charge and discharge, and investigation of the kinetics of those processes.</td>

These results greatly expand the range of amorphous materials that have been considered as hydrogen purification membranes. More importantly, we demonstrate that relatively simple descriptions of the site binding energies in these amorphous materials can account for the key observations from our detailed first-principles calculations.

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A new process for the removal of nitrogen from wastewater is introduced. The process involves three steps: (1) partial nitrification of NH4+ to NO2-; (2) partial anoxic reduction of NO2- to N2O; and (3) N2O conversion to N-2 with energy recovery by either catalytic decomposition to N-2 and O-2 or use of N2O to oxidize biogas CH4. Steps 1 and 3 have been previously established at full-scale. Accordingly, bench-scale experiments focused on step 2. Two strategies were evaluated and found to be effective: in the first, Fe(II) was used to abiotically reduce NO2- to N2O; in the second, COD stored as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) was used as the electron donor for partial heterotrophic reduction of NO2- to N2O. For abiotic reduction with Fe(II), the efficiency of conversion of NO2- to N2O was over 90% with 98% nitrogen removal from water. For partial heterotrophic denitrification, different selection conditions were imposed on acetate- and nitrite-fed communities initially derived from waste activated sludge. No N2O was detected when acetate and nitrite were supplied continuously, but N2O was produced when acetate and nitrite were added as pulses. N2O conversion efficiency was dependent upon the method of addition of acetate and nitrite. When acetate and nitrite were added together (coupled feeding), the N2O conversion efficiency was 9-12%, but when acetate and nitrite additions were decoupled, the N2O conversion efficiency was 60-65%. Decoupled substrate addition selected for a microbial community that accumulated polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) during an anaerobic period after acetate addition then consumed PHB and reduced NO2- during the subsequent anoxic period. The biological N removal efficiency from the water was 98% over more than 200 cycles. This indicates that decoupled operation can sustain significant long-term N2O production. Compared to conventional nitrogen removal, the three-step process, referred to here as Coupled Aerobic-anoxic Nitrous Decomposition Operation (CANDO), is expected to decrease oxygen requirements, decrease biomass production, increase organic matter available for recovery as biogas methane, and enable energy recovery from nitrogen, but pilot-scale studies are needed.</td>

A power conversion efficiency of 5.19% was obtained by inserting a blend layer of DBP and C-70 between the two neat layers, i.e. the so-called p-i-n structure, while the bilayer cell has an efficiency of 3.56%. The significant enhancement in photocurrent was mainly ascribed to absorption of the blend film. Interestingly optical characterization revealed that DBP molecules in the blend film showed a preferable orientation parallel to the substrate surface, suggesting that anisotropic properties can be realized in vacuum deposited donor-acceptor blend films for efficient light harvesting. Photoresponse of the p-i-n cells extended into the spectral range longer than band-edge absorption of the two materials, which is clearly associated with formation of charge transfer states between the DBP donor and C-70 acceptor. On the other hand, the charge transfer states cause increase of saturation current of the diodes, and thus decrease of open circuit voltage. Our results indicate that the controversial effects of such charge transfer states should be considered in organic solar cells with respect to material selection and device design.</td>

In the case of La0.4Sr0.4Fe0.06Ti0.94O2.97, this represents the first time that Fe-0 has been exsolved from a perovskite in such a way.

The presence of electrocatalytically active Fe-0 or Ni-0 nanoparticles and higher V-o(..) concentrations dramatically lowered the activation barrier to steam electrolysis compared to the parent material (x = 0).

Gasification of biomass is used to generate synthesis gas which can be converted to raw hydrocarbons either directly using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or indirectly using catalytic conversion of methanol over ZSM-5. Multiple technologies are considered for generation of the raw hydrocarbons including (i) six types of Fischer-Tropsch units with different temperatures, catalyst types, and hydrocarbon effluent compositions, (ii) methanol conversion using methanol-to-gasoline, and (iii) methanol conversion using methanol-to-olefins. The hydrocarbons are upgraded into the final liquid fuel products (i. e., gasoline, diesel, and kerosene) using one or more technologies including ZSM-5 catalytic conversion, oligomerization, hydrocracking, isomerization, alkylation, and hydrotreating. A simultaneous heat, power, and water integration is included within the process synthesis framework to directly examine the costs associated with utility production and wastewater treatment with a particular topological design. A rigorous global optimization branch-and-bound strategy is implemented to mathematically guarantee the development of a BTL refinery that is economically and environmentally superior to all competing designs. Twenty-four case studies are investigated to determine the effect of refinery capacity, liquid fuel composition, and biomass feedstock on the overall system cost, the BTL refinery topological design, the process material/energy balances, and the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.</td>

Here, we report a method for preparing of oxygen storage materials from layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursors and demonstrate their applications in the CLC process. The LDHs precursor enables homogeneous mixing of elements at the molecular level, giving a high degree of dispersion and high-loading of active metal oxide in the support after calcination. Using a Cu-Al LDH precursor as a prototype, we demonstrate that rational design of oxygen storage materials by material chemistry significantly improved the reactivity and stability in the high temperature redox cycles. We discovered that the presence of sodium-containing species were effective in inhibiting the formation of copper aluminates (CuAl2O4 or CuAlO2) and stabilising the copper phase in an amorphous support over multiple redox cycles. A representative nanostructured Cu-based oxygen storage material derived from the LDH precursor showed stable gaseous O-2 release capacity (similar to 5 wt%), stable oxygen storage capacity (similar to 12 wt%), and stable reaction rates during reversible phase changes between CuO-Cu2O-Cu at high temperatures (800-1000 degrees C). We anticipate that the strategy can be extended to manufacture a variety of metal oxide composites for applications in novel high temperature looping cycles for clean energy production and CO2 capture.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this study, we reported an intermediate-temperature (similar to 150 degrees C) sodium-sulfur (Na-S) battery. With a relatively low operating temperature, this novel battery could reduce the cost and safety issues associated with the conventional high-temperature (300-350 degrees C) Na- S battery. A dense beta ''-Al2O3 solid membrane and tetraglyme were utilized as the electrolyte separator and catholyte solvent in this battery. Solubility tests indicated that a cathode mixture of Na2S4 and S exhibited extremely high solubility in tetraglyme (e.g., &gt;4.1 M for Na2S4 + 4 S). CV scans of Na2S4 in tetraglyme revealed two pairs of redox couples with peaks at around 2.22 and 1.75 V, corresponding to the redox reactions of polysulfide species. The discharge/charge profiles of the Na-S battery showed a slope region and a plateau, indicating multiple steps and cell reactions. In situ Raman measurements during battery operation suggested that polysulfide species were formed in the sequence of Na2S5 + S -&gt; Na2S5 + Na2S4 -&gt; Na2S4 + Na2S2 during discharge and in a reverse order during charge. This battery showed dramatic improvement in rate capacity and cycling stability over room-temperature Na- S batteries, which makes it more attractive for renewable energy integration and other grid related applications.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A comprehensive insight into the correlations of the nanoscale organizations of polymer and nanocrystals in polymer/inorganic nanocrystal bulk heterojunction (BHJ) hybrid solar cells is the key toward nanomorphology control for improving device performance. In this study, we investigated the organizations of both the polymer and nanocrystals in polymer/inorganic nanocrystal hybrid solar cells by performing multiscale molecular simulations of P3HT:TiO2 nanocrystal BHJs incorporating nanocrystals with two different dimensionalities, namely, zero-dimensional nanoparticles (NPs), and one-dimensional nanorods (NRs). We reveal that nanocrystal dimensionality has significant impacts on the polymer/nanocrystal organizations for polymer/inorganic nanocrystal hybrid blends. One-dimensional nanocrystals, such as TiO2 NRs, can effectively enhance the polymer degree of crystallinity as a result of preferential polymer chain alignment along the axial dimension of the NRs, thereby promoting hole transport; in addition, the elongated, anisotropic NRs significantly reduce the probability of electron hopping, and maintain a high specific interfacial area for efficient exciton dissociation. Therefore, the present study demonstrates the possibility of the nanoscale morphology control of polymer/inorganic nanocrystal BHJ hybrid blends via tuning the nanocrystal shapes, which is potentially helpful for developing next-generation polymer/inorganic nanocrystal hybrid electronic devices such as solar cells or thin film transistors.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Side chains and fluorine (F) substituents on conjugated polymers have shown significant impact on the photovoltaic properties of polymer-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, but their respective impact is largely studied independently. In order to disentangle the effect of side chains and F substituents, we comprehensively investigate a series of conjugated polymers with an identical backbone (PNDT-DTBT) but different combinations of side chains and F substituents. Surprisingly, these seemingly marginal changes to the polymer backbone strongly influence the morphology and structure in BHJ thin films (e.g., domain size/purity and the relative orientation of polymer crystallites), as manifested by resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GI-WAXS), thereby exerting significant impact on the photovoltaic properties of these conjugated polymer-based BHJ cells. Devices based on the polymer with long bulky side chains and F substituents (C8,4-C6,2F) simultaneously exhibit large open circuit voltage (V-oc), high short circuit current (J(sc)) and good fill factor (FF), with an efficiency as high as 5.6% for this series of PNDT-DTBT polymers.</td>
